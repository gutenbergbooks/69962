AUTHOR’s DEDICATION.</h2>

<h3>TO MADAME VON DER WENSE, OF THE FAMILY
OF AHLEFELD AT ZELL, LADY OF
THE PRESIDENT VON DER WENSE.</h3>

</div>

<p>It has frequently been said, that poetry, like
love, cannot be commanded. This, my very
amiable Friend must now acknowledge to be
an error, since, if her memory be accurate with
regard to trifles, she will recollect, that this
Drama owes its origin solely and entirely to her
commands.</p>

<p>One evening at Pyrmont, the weather being
too wet and melancholy to permit of her enjoying
the charms of nature, to which her pure
soul is so closely allied, she had recourse to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Temple of Thalia, where Naumann’s Opera of
Cora happened to be represented. The performers
were of a very inferior kind, and the
only thing that pleased me during the evening,
was that I had the good fortune to sit behind
my Friend, who sometimes condescended to
favour her humble servant with a little conversation.
Among other remarks which the occasion
called forth, she observed once, when the
conclusion of an act gave us a short respite from
being merely auditors, that the Opera at which
we were present, contained excellent ground
work for a Drama.</p>

<p>I felt that this idea ought rather to have originated
with me, but I easily found an excuse
for my apparent negligence, in the circumstance
of my being in company with one whose powers
of pleasing were so great and so various, as to
preclude, wherever she was present, the intervention
of any other thoughts but what her own
perfections inspired. Yet I caught eagerly at the
idea when once suggested, and declared to my
friend that her commands only were requisite
for the immediate employment of my pen upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
the subject. For a long time she evaded honouring
me with such a command, preferring,
in all that she said to encourage me to the
undertaking, the politer language of exhortation,
to which her gentle nature is more accustomed.
I however insisted upon a positive command.</p>

<p>“<i>Well then, I command it</i>,” she said, at last,
with the naïveté so peculiarly her own.—I made
a low bow, and now have the honour of presenting
to her my <span class="smcap">Virgin of the Sun</span>. At her
command the trembling maiden appears with
downcast eyes in the anti-chamber, and hopes
for permission humbly to wait there, till a friendly
invitation shall call her to the toilette of her
Patroness.</p>

<p>“Come nearer, gentle creature!—thou shalt
be welcome to me for the sake of thy father,
with whom I have long lived on terms of
friendship, and whom I should now be the
more scrupulous of depriving of what does remain
to him, since he has so little that is desirable
left in the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>Ah, you are but too much in the right, my
most amiable friend!—I once possessed a treasure
who greatly resembled you, inasmuch as she was
one of the best of wives, and of mothers. But
she is gone to her proper home, to the society
of angels. At the moment when I experienced
this most severe of all afflictions, you benignantly
embalmed my sorrows with a tear;—for
that tear my heart retains a lasting gratitude,
and my pen gladly embraces an opportunity, at
the same time of dedicating my work to you, and
of giving this public testimony of the high esteem
entertained for you, by</p>

<h3>SCENE I.—<i>A wild and woody Country, where the Bushes
and Underwood are so closely entwined as to be almost
impenetrable. In the Back-ground, a Wall, in which a
large Breach has been made, is just discernible through
the Trees; and farther back, rises the Cupola of the
Temple of the Sun. Nearer the Front, on the right
Hand, appears a Cave; on the left, a Hill, the Top of
which is seen above the Trees.</i></h3>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Rolla</span> comes down a winding Path among the Bushes,
followed by the <span class="smcap">High-Priest</span>.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">High-Priest.</span></p>

<p>And this is the way to Rolla’s dwelling?—Ah, equally
wild and inaccessible as the way to Rolla’s heart!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Spare me, uncle, I entreat you?—spare me, and
leave me!—If you could understand me——</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Ought I to attempt it?—To understand
thee, means to pay homage to thy idol,—to flatter thy
passion.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Unhappy wretch that I am!—I am a miserable
solitary being!—a drop, which can find no kindred drop
wherewith to associate!—a lonely voice, which cannot find
its echo throughout all animated nature. The worm that
crawls upon this leaf soon meets its help-mate, with whom
it is united—but I—I alone!—Oh ye gods! if it be your
harsh will that, amid the throne of living creatures which
animate creation, I only should be left alone!—(<i>casting
an impatient glance upon the High-Priest</i>) Then—man!—man!—leave
me alone!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Rolla! Rolla! I am indeed old, yet if
affection only be wanting to bring repose to thy heart, thou
wilt find it here in this faithful bosom.—Young man, I
love thee as a father.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Well then, if the happiness of thy son be dear to
thee, suffer him to live according to his own pleasure!—In
this cave I am far happier than thousands who inhabit
pompous palaces. Be this my grave!—only make me
this promise, uncle; it is my sole request: When I shall
be no more, then, on some dark melancholy day, lead Cora
to the entrance of my rugged habitation, and shew her the
remains of Rolla, as they lie upon the cold damp earth on
which he breathed out a life that love had rendered miserable.
Let her see those lips on which the name of his beloved
murderer quivered even to the last gasp; and by the
smile still resting on them, let her know that they closed
blessing the name of Cora. Then perhaps, affected
by this picture, she may strew flowers over my corpse;
or—oh transporting thought!—even embalm it with a
tear!—A tear!—ah! a tear from Cora would recall it
again to life.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Oh enthusiast!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Call me what you please!—Yet, if I be an
enthusiast, think not that I am suddenly become so.
This heart was born to be the seat of mighty passions.—To
the common swarm of emmets which bustle about
the world, I had an aversion, even as a boy. When my
play-mates were merry and sportive around me, I played it
is true, but I always found it irksome, though I never
could precisely ascertain to what cause that feeling might
be ascribed. But when storms lowered around the horizon,
when our mountains vomited forth flames at midnight, or
subterraneous groanings announced an approaching earthquake,
then my heart felt elevated; my languishing spirit
revived; the withered plant again reared its head. As I
advanced in life, no female attractions had power to
charm my eyes;—they remained stedfastly and eagerly
fixed on the more brilliant rays of honour. Blinded to
every beauty of nature, my heart, my throbbing heart,
burned solely to run the career of fame and glory; while
each victory that I obtained, far from proving an assuaging
drop to mitigate the flame, served only to encrease its ardour.—Then
it was that I saw Cora again!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> And the flame which at first burst out with
a force that promised its eternal duration, was instantly extinguished!—Extinguished
as a lamp by the breath of a
child.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> No, not so!—The flame continued to burn, it
only found a different species of nourishment. What was
before a wild and all-consuming blaze, was changed into a
gentle, genial warmth. Honour gave way to love.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> A gentle, genial warmth!—these words
sound well, indeed—But whom does thy flame illumine?—whom
does it warm?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>With indifference</i>) I feel what you would say.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> You feel it, yet are not ashamed?—Young
man!—endowed with powers to achieve the noblest deeds,
perhaps to form the blessing of a whole hemisphere, you
contract your circle of action—within a <span class="smcap">cave</span>!—Inca,
born of the race of the children of the sun, entitled to become
one of the first bulwarks of the throne, you fly—into
a <span class="smcap">cave</span>!—Leader; entrusted by your native country with
the conduct of her armies, and thus called upon, by a succession
of noble actions, to prove yourself worthy so honourable
a confidence, you can yet bury yourself—in a
<span class="smcap">cave</span>!—</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Would you seduce me to be a boaster?—As
Inca, and as leader of the armies of my country, I have
fulfilled my duty through wounds and victories!—Have I
not at various times proved myself deserving of her confidence!—Was
not this more particularly proved on that
awful day when Ataliba’s throne was shaken by Huascar’s
power, and Rolla’s sword dyed the fields of Tumibamba
with the blood of his sovereign’s enemies. Know
you not the history of that day?—One arrow was lodged
in my left arm, another pierced my breast; I received a
large gash in my cheek from a sword, and was stunned by
the stroke of a club upon my forehead. Look at the scars
of those wounds, here, and here, and here!—Yet I never
stirred from the field of battle.—Tell me now, have I given
my country cause to repent her confidence?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>Much affected</i>) Brave youth!—But
were the blessings of thy native-country, the friendship of
thy sovereign, and the love and shouts of thy army, no recompense
to thy heart?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>With a sigh</i>) They were!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> But are so no longer?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> No!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Oh ye gods! ’tis thus by annihilating
the former man, that you chastise this unworthy love
which blights every noble germ implanted in the heart!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Judge not so harshly!—Love, like honour, is
the parent of great actions!—But I—for whom should I
fight?—Is there on earth a heart to which I should communicate
joy, were I longer to pursue the road to fame?—Cora
does not love me!—I have neither father nor mother,
neither brother nor sister!—I am alone in the world.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>Clasping him in his arms</i>) My son!—my
son!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Leave me, leave me, uncle!—I cannot return
this love. You, with those grey hairs, clothed in
those priestly garments, bearing an appearance so solemn,
so entitled to respect, can never become the confident of
my bosom. In you I cannot separate the man from the
dignity of the priesthood.—Ah that I had a mother!—God
created woman to be the confident of man!—Canst thou
not share thy sorrows with her who loves thee? then fly
to thy mother!—But I—I enjoy not the love of any one!—I
have no mother!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Fly then to the gods!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> The gods hate me, because I love a maiden who
is devoted to their service—because I love this maiden more
than I love the gods themselves?—Whether I behold the
sun rise, or see Cora appear, a like impression is made upon
my senses, upon my heart!—Ah no!—Cora makes the
strongest impression on both.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> May the gods pardon this enthusiasm!—Ah,
Rolla! it is thus that the children of mortality always
desire most eagerly, what is impossible to be attained.
Cora, the maiden, had only pleased your fancy—Cora, the
Virgin of the Sun, you love with unbounded passion.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>With rising warmth</i>) What!—(<i>he restrains
himself; but casts a look of indignation upon the High-Priest</i>)
Good night, uncle. (<i>He is going into his cave.</i>)</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Whither art thou going, young man?—Cannot
thy friend, thy sincere friend, obtain some little influence
over thee?—Live according to thy own pleasure!—Withdraw
thyself if thou wilt from mankind, only fly
this desert, where fatal images inevitably disturb thy soul,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
as the wild thorns thy senses. Come to my house!—that
quarter of it which runs down to the sea shore is well
known to thee;—there may’st thou live sequestered and in
solitude, even in the midst of thousands; and there no importunate
intruder shall deprive thee of the visions which
thy heart so fondly loves to cherish. Thy doors may be
closed against me—mine shall always be open to thee.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Uncle, accept my thanks. I feel these proposals
to be meant in kindness—I know your habitation; I know
that it abounds with charms for those who love retirement;
but Rolla is resolved to live and die in this cave. There,
where the cupola of the temple towers above the trees—there
Cora lives—here I can at least behold her dwelling.—Rolla,
then, must live and die in this cave!—Good
night.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Obstinate young man!—Yet, surely
you will not forget what your duty requires during the
solemnities of to-morrow. Your presence in the king’s
palace, and in the temple, is indispensible at the grand festival
of the Sun.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Excuse me!—Say what you please to the king—tell
him I am dead—I come no more among men. Yet
to-morrow I will sacrifice to the gods—whether in a temple,
or in a cave, is alike acceptable to them.—Good
night. <span class="exit">[<i>Exit into his cave.</i></span></p>

<h3>SCENE II.—<i>The <span class="smcap">High-Priest</span> alone.</i></h3>

<p>Young man!—young man!—thou dost not suspect how
deeply this heart is interested in thy repose!—But the
evening sun already glitters upon the golden cupola of the
temple, and here below amid these trees, the night is fast
approaching. I fear I shall find some difficulty in tracing
out the meandering path through this wilderness. (<i>As he
is going, he almost runs against Diego.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE III.—<i><span class="smcap">Diego</span> gropes his Way through the Bushes,
and starts violently at meeting the <span class="smcap">High-Priest</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Whence come you?—and whither would
you go?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Whithersoever chance may conduct a pedestrian.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Do you walk for pleasure in such unbeaten
ways?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>Pertly</i>) Yes.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> You may probably have mistaken your
path?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> So it should seem, since I find myself in your
way.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Are you not Don Alonzo’s attendant?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> You are not very wide of the truth.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> If you be not well acquainted with this
wood, you are in great danger of losing yourself. Accompany
me, and I will conduct you in a short time into the
right path.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>Assuming an angry tone</i>) Who told you that I
was in the wrong path?—Signor High-Priest, I would
have you to know, that neither in Castile nor Arragon,
neither in Grenada nor Murcia, no, nor in any other of
the countries belonging to my king, by whatsoever name
distinguished, has any mother’s son ever been known to
excel Diego in valour and virtue.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>smiling</i>) I readily believe it. And what
gives the greater currency to this assurance is, that it is
uttered by yourself.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> It was forcibly extorted by you, from my modesty.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Pardon me!—And now permit me to request
an explanation of this riddle?—How can you be
wandering at night in so wild a spot as this, and yet be in
the right way?—Are you alone, or is your master near?—What
is it you want?—for never can I be persuaded
that you come hither only for a walk.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>with hesitation</i>) Since you press me so closely
then—I—must confess—that—I am in love.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>smiling</i>) You are in love?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>extravagantly</i>) Yes, in love to desperation!—I
am tortured with jealousy; driven almost to phrenzy!—In
the tumult of passion I am now hurried up to the summits
of the highest hills, now driven into the lowest recesses
of a subterranean cavern,—till at length I have wandered
insensibly into this spot, devoted to tender feelings, here to
hold solitary intercourse with the mournful turtle-doves.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> This spot does indeed seem to be selected
by the gods, as an asylum for enamoured fools.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Here will I tell of my sorrows to the silent trees!—here
breathe out my amorous sighs to the chaste moon!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Thou art a coxcomb! (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>Alone</i>) A coxcomb!—So much the worse
for you Signor!—for if such be the case, the most illustrious
High-Priest of the Sun has been made the sport of a
coxcomb. Live wit, say I—it will fetch its price in the
new world, as well as in the old.—But is he really gone?—Yes.—I
hear nothing more!—Hist!—Hist!—(<i>He goes
and looks out at the other side of the stage.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE IV.—<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Don Alonzo</span> and <span class="smcap">Don Juan</span>.
The latter with a large Cloak wrapped round him.</i></h3>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Are we safe, Diego?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> A fine question, truly.—Yes, as safe as men can
be who are wandering about a forest in the dead of night,
and under the open canopy of heaven, after, saving your
honour’s presence, a piece of knavery. By Saint Barnabas
I believe we are about as safe as a drunkard who should attempt
to cross the river Amazons upon a wire.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Have you seen any thing?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> In the dark I seldom <i>see</i> any thing—but I have
<i>heard</i>—</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> What!—what have you heard?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> The voice of the great High-Priest himself.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> The High-Priest!—What could he want here?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> To put me into the right path, nothing more.
It is the same in this, as in all other countries, Priests are
the only people who are able to lead us into the right path.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> But what could bring him into this wilderness?—Oh,
speak, Velasquez!—tell me, what dost thou think
could be his errand?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> To what purpose speak? What end can conjecture
serve? To rush with my sword drawn, and eyes
averted, into the thickest of the press, is my maxim in any
case of danger. Talking dissipates courage, as a shower
disperses the thin coat of earth scattered over a rock, so
that no foundation remains from which any adventurous
action can shoot forth. If I were disposed to talk, I could
find enough to say.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Of what nature?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Oh speak, Sir, I entreat you!—When it is
dark I always like to hear talking.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Well, it shall be so. It may amuse you too,
Alonzo, till the hour when your constellation shall rise;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
for the time always appears horribly tedious when one is
waiting for a tender appointment. I will therefore talk
till you command my silence; and this shall be the text
with which I introduce my discourse.—My friend, this adventure
bodes no good!—believe me, it bodes no good!</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Right, Sir, right.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> This is language foreign to thy sentiments.
When has the time been known that Don Juan Velasquez
turned his back upon an adventure, because it was dangerous?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> There is the matter!—Hear me, Alonzo!—If
thou wert capable of doubting my courage, I might
easily prove it, by engaging the next rattle-snake I should
meet. Thou knowest my principle, that I do not value my
life more highly, than a moment of happiness, and happy is
every moment that I sacrifice to friendship. If, therefore,
thou hast any regard for me, no more of this!—My arm,
my sword, are devoted to thy service—I have followed thee
blindly into the labyrinth in which we are now involved;
but I must still be permitted to think, that we do not give
any proof of our wisdom in groping our way here when
we might be more advantageously employed.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> More advantageously?—let me hear in what
way?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> He who is doing ill, may always be more advantageously
employed; and by the blood of all the knights
that does or does not flow in my veins, I think we
are now cursedly in the wrong. I say nothing of the sword
suspended by a thread over our heads—affection takes precedence
of life—You love Cora—I have the strongest
attachment to you, and Diego is attached to both.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Certainly, certainly, Sir!—but—notwithstanding—pray
don’t take it amiss, if I think that life has precedence
of affection.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Granted therefore that the prosecution of this
enterprise should prove the means of shortening the duration
of our lives, yet we perhaps only give up some years
of unhappiness ourselves, to purchase the happiness of a
friend.—And since they have lived long, who have lived
happily, and he only can be esteemed to have lived happily
who has died so; what better can we wish, or how can we
end our lives more satisfactorily, than in offering them up
a sacrifice to friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Cursed maxims, these!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> But, Alonzo, to be happy, according to my
ideas of happiness, you will understand that I consider this
salutary state of the soul as inseparable from integrity and
virtue. Lay your hand then upon your heart, and tell me
what are now your feelings in moments of temperance and
reflection?—Don Alonzo Molina quitted the savage followers
of Pizarro, because he abhorred their barbarities—that
was a noble principle!—I will go, he said, among
these mild and benevolent people, and by cultivating their
minds, and instructing them in the arts of civilized life,
become their friend and benefactor.—Objects worthy of
my friend!—But what has been the end of these virtuous
resolutions?—You came among them indeed—the king of
the country received you with open arms and an expanded
heart—the people loved you—the family of the Incas honoured
you—the great men of the nation beheld you without
envy, enjoying the favour of their sovereign. You
shared that sovereign’s cares; but you also shared his joys,
his wealth;—you were no longer considered as a foreigner,
and even the priests themselves murmured not when they
saw you appear at the worship of their gods.—Oh fatal
forbearance!—On one of these solemn days, my noble
friend beheld in the temple one of the priestesses of the sun,
as she presented the bread of sacrifice to the king.—She
was young—she was lovely—Alonzo’s heart was instantly
lost—and at the same moment all the grand designs he had
formed, were sunk in the ocean of forgetfulness.—The
champion for the rights of humanity slumbered upon his
post, while the charming device upon his shield, the united
hands beneath a cross surrounded with sun-beams, gave
way to a burning heart, pierced through with arrows.—And
now, if I wish to speak with Alonzo, where must I
seek him?—Among the counsellors of the king—the
judges of the people—or the instructors of youth?—It
was among these, or such as these, that I should once have
expected to find him:—but now, now he is only to be
found stealing nightly about these walls, or behind these
walls, with his face deeply buried in his cloak, hiding himself
from his own conscience—while all his glorious projects
are crushed in the embryo, as the future brood is destroyed
by a mischievous boy who breaks the eggs of the
setting hen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Indignantly</i>) Velasquez!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Away with that menacing countenance, it ill accords
with your situation. A man should not dare to
assume the privilege of growing angry, unless his conscience
be pure.—You will perhaps wonder at the jocund
Velasquez becoming on a sudden a preacher of morality—but
Velasquez was only jocund and light-hearted, because
he was an honest man—let him therefore preach on, since
he has entered upon the subject. You, by whom formerly
every article of popular faith, even to the most minute, was
held inviolate, because you considered that to every one was
attached, in a considerable degree, the peace of mind of
some weak, but honest man—you now rashly bid defiance
to one of the most sacred tenets of a whole nation that has
received you hospitably into their bosom, and seduce a
chaste virgin devoted to their gods.—The conflicts of nature
herself, are made subservient to your desires; and
while a dreadful earthquake shakes these inaccessible walls
even to their foundation, the bold intruder takes advantage
of the passage thus opened to him to rush into
Cora’s arms, and amidst this elemental warfare to murder
innocence.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Forbear, Velasquez!—have you no compassion
for me?—believe me, my conscience does not slumber.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Well then, if it slumber not, it is at least deaf,
and the malady must be removed.—Ataliba is thy benefactor,—this
amiable people have received thee as a
brother,—and thou, assassin-like, art stabbing them in the
dark.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Oh Velasquez, once more I entreat you to
forbear!—I acknowledge, with gratitude, the voice of
friendship,—but what wouldst thou require of me?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Heaven be thanked that I have succeeded at last
in awakening you to some degree of reflection!—I require
of you instantly to renounce this dangerous and criminal
intercourse.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Well, I will consult with Cora.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Most admirable!—Cora is indeed the proper
person to decide upon this matter. I perceive that you
are seriously impressed with my lecture.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Rely upon me!—I will represent to her all
that anxious love can suggest—the anger of the king—the
indignation of the people—my danger—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Your danger!—Pardon the interruption, my
friend, but you speak here without much reflection!—Your
danger put in the balance against hers, is as a handful
of down weighed against a bar of gold. You hazard only
your life—</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> What the devil, and is not that enough?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> She, on the contrary, hazards her fame, her repose,
her father’s blessing, the love of her family, her
prospect of salvation—and, to sum up all—she must encounter
the most horrible of all deaths, supposing that this
intercourse should give existence to a being who would
prove the betrayer of your loves.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Oh talk not of it!—No, no, Velasquez, thank
heaven I am not so deeply involved in guilt!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Heaven be thanked indeed, if you are yet clear
from it?—but while you continue in your present course,
what security can you have, that you will always remain so.
And should a consequence so fatal ensue, think only on the
boundless misery that it must bring both on Cora and
yourself. That she must die would be little; the horrible
idea is, the manner of her death. Shut up alive in a subterraneous
vault, the opening of which will be closed upon
her for ever, with only a single loaf of bread and a small
lamp, she must sit gasping for air, and soon endure the severest
torments of hunger.—Oh the very thought makes
me shudder!—I have encountered death undauntedly under
a variety of forms; but I could not bear to meet him
under this.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Falling on his neck.</i>) I will never see Cora
again!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Worthily resolved!—let us then instantly depart!—(<i>Endeavours
to draw him away.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Only permit me to take leave of her!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Write her a letter, which we will throw over the
wall—You hesitate!—Oh you are undecided!—Ha! already
I see the hapless Cora enclosed in her horrible dungeon,
crushed by the two-fold agony of bodily and mental
torments, lying on the ground and gnawing her own flesh—uttering
the most dreadful execrations against her God,
and amid the wildest ravings of phrenzy breathing out that
soul, the purity of which was poisoned by thee. Then
when she shall stand before him who hereafter will judge
alike the Peruvian and the Spaniard, and shall accuse thee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
as the origin of all her woes, the occasion of her becoming
the murderer of her child——</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Eagerly pulling Juan forwards.</i>) Come,
come!—let us fly!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> With the utmost transport! (<i>As they are going,
a clapping of hands is heard behind the wall.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Turning suddenly round</i>) That is her signal!
my Cora! my Cora!—(<i>He breaks away from Velasquez,
and climbs hastily over the breach in the wall.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE V.—<i><span class="smcap">Don Juan</span>, and <span class="smcap">Diego</span>. Juan looks
after Alonzo with Astonishment and Indignation.</i></h3>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>After a pause.</i>) Now do I defy any one to
assert again, that sound is an empty thing—a nothing.
The most reverend Don Juan Velasquez has been for a
long time holding such a discourse here as is not delivered
every day, even from the pulpit of Salamanca, but the moment
that three or four claps are given by a pair of heathenish
hands, the wretch for whose benefit this fine oration
was intended, loses every beneficial impression, gives them
all to the winds, and runs headlong after his own wild inventions.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>With some asperity</i>) Farewell my friend!
Since thou art resolved on ruin, take thine own course!—Oh
madman! madman!—where others only walk he runs,
where others enter slowly and only step by step, thither he
rushes. Well, well, even if what I have urged prove of
no avail, friendship has however discharged its duty—and
the worst that can happen is at last to be reduced to suffer
with my friend. Till then, be of good heart, Diego!—How
dost thou find thyself?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Like a fish upon dry land.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Thou dost not speak truly. When a fool is
running on the wrong side of the post, he is in his proper
element; and, by Saint George, I think we are running
cursedly on the wrong side of the post here.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Only with this difference, that I <i>must</i> do as you
<i>please</i>—and you are not <i>pleased</i> to do what God and sound
reason require of you.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Well, let us hear what your wisdom would
suggest.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Were I in the place of the valiant knight Don<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Juan de Velasquez, in the first place I would deliver a
discourse pretty nearly to the same purpose as he has done;
but then if that produced no effect, I would say—my dear
friend Alonzo, or my dear Don Alonzo, you cannot expect
that I should stay to be roasted alive for your sake!—Fare
thee well—I shall return home, and take our worthy
Diego with me.—We will say over our beads in your behalf.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> That may as well be done here.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Here!—on heathen ground!—in view of a
heathen temple!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Blockhead!—Our God is every where, and by
a firm adherence to the sacred claims of friendship we serve
him more acceptably than by saying over a rosary—therefore
will I offer no prayers at this moment. I am here as
the guardian of my misguided friend.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> And pray then in what capacity am I here?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> As his attendant, whom he employs to carry
his arms.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> My presence then, it should seem, is now
wholly superfluous, since I am not permitted to appear
publickly as such.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Thy part is to obey, not to remonstrate. Go,
take this whistle, and steal silently to the left, along the
wall that surrounds the Temple, while I go round by the
right—we shall by this means meet on the other side; and
should you encounter any thing suspicious by the way,
make use of the whistle. Here, take it.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>Trembling as he takes it</i>) To the left did you
say?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Yes, to the left.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> And quite alone?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Yes, quite alone.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> I am afraid of losing myself among the bushes.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Fool, can you not see the wall, and the cupola
of the Temple?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Do you take me for an owl?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Is not the moon bright enough to light thee?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> No!—Ha! ha! ha!—Fear seems wholly to have
deprived Signor Diego of his senses.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> I must beg leave to observe, Sir, that the night is
devoted to rest, and even if the man himself be not allowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
to sleep, his internal courage, commonly takes the liberty
of enjoying a comfortable nap. My fortitude always goes
to bed with the sun.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Going up to him earnestly</i>) Friend Diego, we
will awaken it with some hearty blows.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>Shrinking away from him</i>) Oh it is easily
awakened: it does not sleep very soundly.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Go, then, fool!—(<i>He thrusts him off on one side,
and goes off himself on the other.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE VI.—<i><span class="smcap">Alonzo</span> springs over the Ruins of the
Wall, and then reaches his Hand to <span class="smcap">Cora</span>, who follows
him.</i></h3>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>As he assists her</i>) Only one little jump, dear
Cora!—throw yourself boldly into my arms!—Here will
you find a secret and retired spot, formed for love, and
guarded by friends. This is not so wide and waste a scene
as your garden, in which, barren as it is of all shade, the
treacherous moon betrays every form that ventures within
its circuit. (<i>He presses her to his bosom</i>) At length I have
thee in my arms again.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Returning his embrace</i>) And I have thee again
in mine.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Ah! it is now three long weeks——</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Only three weeks?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Months to love.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Years to my heart.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Every evening at twilight has poor Alonzo
wandered hither, and listened in anxious expectation of
the signal which might summon him to a night of
transport.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> And every evening has Cora wept because she
dared not meet Alonzo.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> You have not been ill, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Ah! I am always ill when I am not with you.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Say, dearest Cora, what has prevented our
meeting?—You promised that I should sooner——</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Did I <i>promise</i>?—That was not right, as I could
only hope that it might be sooner; but love always adds
hopes to its wishes, and too soon begins to consider those
hopes as certainties. It does not often fall to my lot to
take the nightly service in the temple, but I relied upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
having the turn of one of my companions who was ill, and
whose place I had offered to supply. She, however, recovered;
and, instead of the promised happiness, I had only
her thanks for my intentions. Poor Cora was heartily
vexed at this disappointment, and her sleepless nights appeared
so tedious.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Alas! I have also been a stranger to rest.
The dews of morning found me under these trees, while
my cloaths were still damp with the dews of the past evening,
and my limbs still shivered with the cold of midnight.
Beneath yon palm-tree have I stood, night after night,
with my eyes fixed upon your temple; and often, as
I have seen a form wander backwards and forwards, where
glimmers the eternal lamp, I have pleased myself with
thinking that it might be Cora’s.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> It was not that in my solitude I could be deceived
by shadows, yet I seemed every where to see your
image. The idea made me restless, and I ran with hurried
steps hither and thither—kept incessantly moving from one
spot to another. Oh tell me, does love always render people
impatient?—It was not thus with me formerly;
but I was gentle, quiet, and bore without a murmur the
failure of any trifling wish; the disappointment of any
cherished expectation—whether it were that a shower deprived
me of a promised walk, or that the wind destroyed
the flowers which I had carefully reared with my own
hands. Now all is changed; I am no longer the same
person. When I sit at my daily employments, and spin,
or weave, if a thread happen to break, I am so peevish that
I sometimes even startle at myself. (<i>Caressing him</i>) Tell
me, Alonzo, does love improve, or spoil us?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> True love improves.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Oh no, no!—True love reigns in my heart, yet
I am not so good as I was.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> It is only that thy blood runs somewhat more
swiftly.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Or else that I am ill.—Yes, I am now often ill.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Yes, indeed!—But that must be so—for soon—soon—I
shall not love you alone.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Starting</i>) Not me alone?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Smiling</i>) Not you alone!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Your words involve a riddle, or else a crime.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Cora, love cannot comprehend more than one object.—You
will not love me alone? (<i>He fixes his eyes earnestly
upon her</i>) No, you cannot mean to say so—if it were true,
you could not look at me with so much composure, such
perfect unreserve.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> And why should I not look at you with composure?—My
feelings are so sweet that they cannot be criminal.
An unknown, but pleasing sadness has taken possession
of my heart—I experience sensations not to be described.
When lately at the Solstitial feast, I was ornamenting
the porch of the temple with flowers, I saw upon
the lowest of the steps which lead up to it, a young woman
sleeping, at whose breast lay a little smiling angel: my heart
was altogether dissolved at so interesting a spectacle, and I involuntarily
stretched out my arms to the child, intending
to take it gently from its mother, and press it to my bosom.
But how easily are the slumbers of a tender mother disturbed;
for scarcely had I touched the babe ere she awoke,
rose up anxiously, clasped her treasure to her heart, and
cast on me a look of deep distrust. Say, Alonzo?—Do
you not think an affectionate mother one of the most respectable
of creatures?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Bewildered</i>) Oh, why that question?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Can’t you guess?—(<i>With pure and innocent
transport</i>) I shall soon be a mother myself.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Thunderstruck</i>) Great God!!!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> What is the matter?—You need not be alarmed!—I
love you more than ever!—Ah, at the first commencement
of our love I thought it impossible that the attachment
I then felt could ever be exceeded; for in you,
Alonzo, I beheld the most charming of youths. But, enchanter,
you have stolen into my heart under a still more
attractive form, since I behold in you, the father of my
child.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Cora! Cora!—my hair is erect with horror,
while your mind seems wholly at ease.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> And what do you fear?—Is it a crime to become
a mother?—My father always taught me, that whoever
commits a crime, instantly forfeits all peace of mind;
but for me, I feel no uneasiness.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Do you not recollect the circumstances of your
situation?—To what rigid ordinances you swore obedience
when this figure of the sun was fastened upon your
bosom?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I swore to obey the ordinances of our temple.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> And what do they enjoin you?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I know not. My father told me, that by whomsoever
virtue was held sacred, its precepts would be fulfilled
without particular instruction. To me virtue is
sacred.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> And know you then what constitutes virtue?—Alas!
your uncorrupted soul is ignorant of the terrible
distinction between virtue as founded in the eternal principles
of nature, and virtue as constituted by the distorted
imaginations of fanatics. (<i>He clasps her eagerly in his
arms</i>) Oh, Cora! Cora! what have we done?—In other
situations, love and joy recompense the anguish which
every mother must endure—in yours alone, those sufferings,
however severe, are but the forerunners of others still more
dreadful, in the most horrible of all deaths.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Death!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>In accents of despair</i>) And I—I am your murderer!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>With composure</i>) How can you thus unnecessarily
torment yourself?—Wherefore, and by whom, should
I be put to death?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> The priests will affirm, that you have offended
the gods.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I offended the gods!—No, Alonzo, I love the
gods.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Cora, I do not doubt it; yet you must become
the victim of an ancient superstition. Our only safety
would be in flight; but, alas! whither can we fly in a foreign
land?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Be composed, dear enthusiast!—I have thought
of means to console you.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> If so, it must be the suggestion of God himself.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> The plan is simple, yet will give me certain assurance
whether or not the gods are really incensed against
me; and the approaching morning may decide this important
question. Hitherto the moon and stars alone have
been the confidents of our love; but the sun himself, the
greatest of all our gods, shall now be witness to it.—At
present I dare not stay any longer, for I must hasten back
to attend the eternal lamp in the temple. Do you then,
Alonzo, rest here under these trees, and, as soon as the
dawn of morning shall begin to gild the eastern horizon, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
will return, and we will ascend yonder hill together.
Then will we turn our faces towards the east, entwine our
arms within each other, join lip to lip, and thus boldly
wait the rising of the sun.—You understand me?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> But half.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Do you not comprehend, that if Cora have done
evil, either the sun will veil himself from her sight, or the
first ray of his light that falls upon her, will annihilate the
criminal. But if, oh Alonzo! he, my Father, and my God,
shall rise clear and resplendent—if he shall smile upon the
affectionate pair as he beholds them joined in mutual embrace,
then shall we have a certain token that he favours
our love, and your mind may be relieved from its cares—for
when satisfied that we are guiltless in the eyes of the
sun, whose eyes shall Cora need to fear.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Oh affecting simplicity!—Oh sweetest of thy
sex!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> But, more still remains, my Alonzo. To-morrow
is the grand festival of the sun—if on that day he rise
in unveiled majesty, we always regard it as a joyful signal,
that the gods are favourably disposed towards us, consequently
that no dreadful crime can have called forth their
anger. Then look up, Alonzo; cast thy eyes around the
heavens; behold how the stars glitter; how blue and serene
is every part within our view!—not a cloud threatens us—not
a zephyr moves the trees—Oh we shall have a glorious
morning!—One embrace then at parting—farewel!—Let
Cora at her return find thee sleeping beneath these
trees, and then will she awaken thee with a kiss. (<i>She
hastens back through the breach in the wall.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Who, sunk in astonishment and horror, has
scarcely heard what Cora has been saying</i>) Sweet, benevolent
creature!—Oh I have been a villain, the worst of
villains! Let me save her!—save her, if it be possible,
before the flame shall burst out over her head!—Ah, it is
too late! She is irrecoverably lost, and I can only die with
her. (<i>He leans against a tree with both hands upon his
forehead.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE VII.—<i><span class="smcap">Diego</span> enters from the right side, and
seeing <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>, whistles with all his Strength.</i></h3>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Turning round wildly, and grasping his sword</i>)
What is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Springing forwards from the left side</i>) What
is the matter?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Is it you, Don Alonzo?—Why did you not say
immediately that it was you?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Clapping Diego upon the shoulder</i>) My friend,
you must take a frightened hare for your device.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Better than a blind lion. Signor Velasquez,
you knights consider it as one of the duties of your order
to revile prudence as cowardice, in the same manner as
we who cannot write, call all learned men, in derision,
feather heroes. Did not you yourself order me to whistle
whenever I should encounter any thing suspicious?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Fool! how long has thy master been an object
of suspicion to thee?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> To tell you the truth, Signor Don Juan, some
time. Look at him now, how he stands there. (<i>Pointing
to Alonzo, who has resumed his former attitude.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Shaking Alonzo</i>) My dear friend, was the adieu
then so very heart-breaking?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Falling on his neck</i>) Ah, Velasquez, thy admonitions
came too late!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Oh God!—What!—is she?——</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> She is indeed!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Then may we consider our prospect of seeing
the kingdom of heaven as no very distant one.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Taking Juan’s hand</i>) Oh do not forsake me,
my friend, my companion, my brother in arms!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Shaking his hand ardently</i>) Alonzo, it is not
my practice to call to the boy who is struggling in the
water, “<i>You should not have fallen in</i>:”—I would rather,
if it were possible, draw him out. But, by the powers
above, I do not know what is to be done here!—Had we
a vessel at our command, or could we procure an enchanter’s
cloak, which would convey us through the air, then
would not I be among the last to recommend flight. But
since no such means lie at present within our reach, the
course to be pursued is not very obvious. Well, well, Velasquez!
arm thyself with courage to meet the worst—wrap
thyself up in thy cloak, even to the very teeth, and
leave the thunder to rattle, and the lightning to flash
quietly around thee.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Wringing his hands</i>) All is lost! No resource,
no way of escape left!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Be not so desponding. All is not lost as long
as a man retains his senses. Let us depart, eat, drink, and
take our rest;—then, by to-morrow, both mind and body
will have acquired new strength, and we shall be better
able to consider what is to be done.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Oh, flower of knighthood!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Stop! she will return soon; she promised me at
the dawn of morning——</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> So, so!—Well, of all employments under the
sun, commend me to that of being confident to a lover!
They have no idea that a man can have any human feelings—that
he must sleep——</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> That he must eat—that he must drink—</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Forgive me!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Yes, yes, I forgive you freely; but you must
inscribe this sacrifice deeply in your heart; for, by Heaven!
the loss of my night’s rest—yet, no, rather than lose it, I
will repose under the trees. (<i>He spreads out his cloak,
and lies down upon it</i>) It is always good to make a virtue
of necessity; so, with the sage remark, that weariness is
the best of all opiates, I wish you a good night, Alonzo.
He who has an unsullied conscience can sleep, even with
the trunk of a tree only for his pillow, as soundly as the
seven sleepers themselves. (<i>He closes his eyes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>Also spreading himself a bed</i>) If there should
happen to be a rattle-snake or two hereabouts—or, perchance,
a tyger as hungry as myself!—Hold! an idea occurs
to me. (<i>He takes out a rosary, which he hangs upon
the nearest tree</i>) Now I think we are safe. (<i>He lies
down</i>) If I can sleep now, who will say that I am not a
master in the trade; for my head is full of thought, my
heart full of fear, and my poor stomach quite empty.
(<i>He falls asleep.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Contemplates both for a while, then exclaims</i>)
Happy men! (<i>He leans in musing melancholy against a tree.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE I.—<i>The Scene remains the same as at the Close of
the first Act. <span class="smcap">Don Juan</span> and <span class="smcap">Diego</span> are still sleeping.—<span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>
walks about mournfully among the Trees.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alonzo.</span></p>

<p>Will this night never come to an end?—The stars
still twinkle in the heavens, the moon scarcely yet begins
to lose her lustre, and a deep and solemn silence reigns
around.—More grateful to the sinner’s soul are noise and
tumult, for they assist to deaden the voice of conscience.—What
said the fool Diego lately?—that it is the same
with conscience as with the stomach, the moment either
compels us to feel its existence, we may be sure it is
not in perfect health.—And the fool spoke truly.—Oh my
excellent mother! thy golden instructions may one day
conduct me into a better world—they have not taught me
how to conduct myself in another hemisphere!—Perhaps
at this very moment thou art upon thy knees, praying for a
blessing upon thy fallen son!—Ah, pray for him! intercede
for him!—he needs the intercession of a saint!—But
away, away ye gloomy thoughts!—All may yet be well!—Night
is followed by twilight—twilight by the first rays
of the rising sun!—(<i>Looking towards the east</i>) And see
there the precursor of returning joy!—Already the east
begins to be streaked with purple, and the stars are disappearing.—Hist!
I hear the chirping of a distant bird!—the
moment draws near which is to bring Cora back to
her Alonzo!—while I press her to my bosom, conscience
is mute, and I can laugh at danger. I will awaken these
sleepers. (<i>He shakes Diego</i>) Diego, rise,—it is already
day.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>Rubbing his eyes</i>) Hey!—how!—you joke!
it is still dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> No, no, the moon is going down, the stars are
vanishing.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>Yawning</i>) Take heed what you are about,
or you will soon find that it is dark enough. (<i>He turns on
the other side, mutters some inarticulate words, and falls
asleep again.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> If that fellow have not slept, or eaten his fill,
he is like a watch not wound up. (<i>He shakes Don Juan</i>)
Velasquez, the day begins to break!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Raising himself up, and looking about</i>) Well!—and
what of that?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Will you not rise and enjoy so fine a morning?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Write an Ode upon the Morning, if it be so
very fine; but prithee let me sleep quietly. (<i>He lies down
again.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Have you forgotten that we may soon expect
Cora?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> That is no concern of mine, she does not come
to see me.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> And don’t you think it worth while to unbar
your eyes a few minutes earlier, to see an angel?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> I will dream of her. (<i>He falls asleep.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> There they lie and sleep as tho’ in mockery of
the troubles of my soul. Ah, it is only the unembarrassed
mind which can thus recruit itself by inactivity. Yes, I
perceive that the more man throws off his rational nature,
and assimilates himself with the brute, who looks to sense
alone for his enjoyments, the happier is his lot.—Happier?—Most
certainly so; in his own eyes, at least, if not in
the eyes of wisdom; and what more can be required? (<i>A
clapping of hands is heard behind the walls</i>) But hark?—she
comes!—Oh, all that I have said of sensual delight is
false! One moment, when the soul partakes of real transport,
outweighs whole hours of mere corporeal pleasure.
(<i>He hastens to meet Cora.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE II.—<i><span class="smcap">Cora</span> enters and springs into <span class="smcap">Alonzo’s</span>
Arms.</i></h3>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Here I am, dearest Alonzo!—But you have deprived
Cora of an expected pleasure.—I hoped to have
found you buried in sleep—I meant to have concealed myself
behind a tree, to have scattered leaves over you, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
then reproved you as a sluggard.—Do you not hear me,
Alonzo, or are you in a waking dream?—else, when your
arm is thrown around my neck, how can you stand with
eyes thus fixed, and think of any thing besides your Cora?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Amiable creature! suspect me not unjustly!—Cora
alone rules in my heart, as one sun alone rules in the
heavens.—Yet I cannot cease to think of the discovery
made this night!—My peace! my peace of mind is lost!—Conscience,—a
thousand horrible images.—Death in its
most hideous form, with cold and outstretched arms, tearing
Cora from my heart,—these, these are the ideas which
haunt me incessantly.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Laying her hand upon his mouth</i>) Be silent and
trust to the gods!—Look up, the heavens are clear and
serene all around us, and my heart is full of transport!—Soon
will the sun be risen above the horizon, hasten,
hasten to ascend the hill! (<i>She climbs hastily up the hill,
Alonzo following her</i>) Oh behold!—a minute longer and
we had been too late—see how the east already glitters with
streaks of gold—see how the twilight vanishes over the
hills and woods—see what thousands of dew-drops sparkle
with the rays of morning, and listen to the notes of birds
innumerable, warbling their early songs! Oh, Alonzo!
My God is great!—My breast is too contracted for all my
feelings!—Burst forth,—burst forth, ye tears of transport
which stand in my eyes!—Rejoice with me, my love; behold
where the God ascends in unclouded majesty—he is
not offended. (<i>She kneels.</i>) Father, to whose service I
have devoted myself!—Father, whose image I bear externally
on my bosom, and internally in my heart!—Vouchsafe
to cast one of thy many eyes upon me, be witness of
my love for this young man, and be my judge!—If the
feelings which now engross my soul be sinful, then veil
thy flaming forehead in darkness, or command thy thunder-clouds
to gather round thee, and send down upon me thy
forked lightning, as the minister of thy vengeance!—Give
me, oh Father!—Give me a sign of thy love or of thy
anger!—(<i>After a pause</i>) Oh with what mildness, what
gentleness, do his rays fall upon me!—how benignantly he
looks down and blesses me!—(<i>She rises</i>) Well then I dare
venture upon the trial—dare venture to make it even in
the presence of my God himself!—Alonzo, come to my
arms. (<i>She embraces him</i>) It is over, and now all my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
fears are dispelled!—Had this embrace been sinful, he had
annihilated us both at this moment!—My heart is full
of joy and gratitude!—Come let us kneel together!—together
pray—together give thanks!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> I pray with thee?—Dear Cora, the sun is not
my God.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Oh yes, he is equally yours and mine. Does he
not shine upon all?—to all give light and warmth?—I entreat
you, kneel with me.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Dear Cora!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Ungrateful man!—to whom do you owe your
Cora?—Would I in the presence of my God be ashamed of
you, my Alonzo?—Oh then if indeed you love me!—(<i>She
kneels and takes his hand to draw him after her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Who could resist such sweet enthusiasm! (<i>He
kneels by her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Let silent thanks,—the inward emotions of our
hearts be the only incense we offer.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> These I present to thee, God of all gods!
(<i>They both remain in silent prayer.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE III.—<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Rolla</span> from his Cave.</i></h3>

<p>Is it so early!—The sun is scarcely risen!—Alas, thus
he sets and rises again, yet ever finds me wakeful!—But
let me arm myself with patience, and the time will shortly
come when he will find me sleeping for ever!—(<i>He sees
Don Juan and Diego</i>) Who have we here?—two of the
strangers who live among us—doubtless they have lost
their way among these bushes, and have been overtaken by
the night. I will awake them, and present them with refreshments;—yet
first let me offer my morning prayers to
thee, my Father!</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Rolla</span> turns to the East, and as he raises his hands and
eyes towards Heaven, suddenly espies the lovers kneeling upon
the hill, at sight of whom, he utters a shriek of horror, and remains
immoveable as if he had seen a spirit. <span class="smcap">Cora</span> and
<span class="smcap">Alonzo</span> rise slowly with their faces still turned towards the
sun, and sink into a silent embrace. <span class="smcap">Rolla</span> overpowered, exclaims
with a voice almost suffocated with anguish, “<span class="smcap">Cora!!!</span>”
The lovers start affrighted, turn round, and look down—<span class="smcap">Cora</span>
sinks in a swoon upon the declivity of the hill.——<span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>
after hesitating a few moments whether to hasten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
down, or stay and assist <span class="smcap">Cora</span>, at length decides on the latter,
kneels by her, and endeavours to recover her. <span class="smcap">Rolla</span> trembling
with agony, yet unable to stir from the spot, remains with
his eyes fixed upon the lovers. <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span> at length exclaims</i>
Velasquez! Diego! to arms! to arms! (<i><span class="smcap">Juan</span> and <span class="smcap">Diego</span>
spring up, but are scarcely awake.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> What is the matter?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> What is the matter?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Seize him!—Don’t let him escape!</p>

<p><i>Juan and Diego.</i> (<i>Still staggering with sleep, yet endeavouring
to draw their swords</i>) Where! whom!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Seize him! secure him! he will escape!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Recovering himself, and pointing to Rolla</i>) That
man? that single man?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>Brandishing his sword</i>) Two to one!—I am
your man for that!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Secure him I say! we are betrayed!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> A single unarmed man! (<i>He returns his sword
into the scabbard.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Quitting Cora, who is not yet recovered, draws
his sword and rushes down the hill towards Rolla, who keeps
his eyes immoveably fixed upon Cora</i>) Then I must myself.—</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Seizing him by the arm</i>) Hold, my friend—or
rather my enemy, if you move a step.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> My God, Velasquez, have you lost your senses?
We are betrayed! you risk Cora’s life! (<i>Endeavouring to
break away from him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Eagerly thrusting him back</i>) Restrain your
passion! (<i>He goes up to Rolla.</i>) Surely you are not unknown
to me.—Is it not Rolla whom I behold?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Somewhat recovering himself.</i>) I—who am I?
Yes, my name is Rolla.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Rolla, the champion of his country?—Yes, it
is he, and in him I salute one of the bravest and noblest of
men.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> How is this? it is yet early morning! (<i>Striking
his hand upon his forehead.</i>) Am I in a dream? (<i>After
a pause, and fixing his eyes again stedfastly upon Cora</i>) No!—By
all the gods it is no dream?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Oh no!—Howsoever severe may be the censure
which your eyes denounce against the scene before you—in
how horrible a light soever you may be inclined to
consider the truth, still it must be owned that this is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
dream. Probably you may recognize that maiden by the
figure of your deity which adorns her bosom. She is a
<span class="smcap">Virgin of the Sun</span>.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> And her name is Cora.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> This young man too, you may also recollect—he
is the favourite of your king, that Alonzo who saved the
life of Ataliba at Cannara, while Rolla was fighting in
support of his throne under the walls of Cuzco.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Offering his hand to Alonzo</i>) Yes, it is the
same Alonzo.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> And now, Rolla, if you be indeed the man
I believe you, your sentiments and feelings must differ
widely from those of your priests, who having their eyes
almost continually fixed upon the sun, when they chance
to look downward towards the earth, see all things here
below through a false medium, so that scarcely any object
appears under its proper form and colour. You know the
world, and mankind, know how the heart is eternally
swayed by circumstances, now this way, now that, and
what numberless passions contend for sovereignty within it.
Among these, Love is always resisted with the greatest difficulty—indeed
is scarcely to be withstood, but where, in
making the attack, he has not deigned to exert all his powers.
Look at that virgin—she is lovely——</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Great God!—to whom is this observation addressed.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Look at this youth—he is ardent, impetuous.
That he saw and loved her is his only crime.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> It is no crime.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> There spake Rolla!—I was not deceived in
him!—</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> And you will keep our secret?—will avert,
nameless, misery from the unfortunate Cora?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Think you, that I could betray her?—Know,
young man, that for years I have loved, have idolized
her.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo and Juan.</i> (<i>At the same moment and with the utmost
astonishment</i>) You!!!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Oh the impotence of words!—Not my language—not
your language—not all the languages of the
world combined, have power to describe what I feel for
Cora?—She was scarcely above the age of childhood when
I marched for the first time against the rebels who inhabit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the fields at the foot of the mountains of Sangay—she
wept when I bade her adieu, and since our separation, I
have known no pleasure but in the recollection of that
moment and of those tears. When the contest was ended, I
returned, but all had then assumed a new aspect. No longer
was I to behold the same free unfettered maiden whom
I had left, she was become the confident of the gods. I
would have made her my wife, she saw the purity of the
flame with which I burned, she saw the ardour of my passion,
but her heart was wholly occupied with her new situation,
and while she called the sun her husband, she looked
down with contempt upon me. The day soon arrived on
which a solemn oath consecrated her for ever to the service
of her God, and consigned me over as a victim to eternal
misery. Still I continued for several years to drag about a
miserable existence from place to place, from battle to
battle, and while I sought death gained only renown. At
length I retired to this spot, and for some weeks past, this cave
has been my dwelling.—This cave, which has become dear
to me since it conceals from my sight that sun who robbed
me of my Cora!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Who during this narrative has again hastened
to Cora, and endeavoured, though still in vain, to recover
her.</i>) I pity you from my soul!—believe me I pity you
from my soul!—But how can I trust a rival?—Swear that
you will not betray us.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> I will not swear.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> No!—and yet you pretend to love Cora?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> What need of oaths since I do love her?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> For the satisfaction of my mind.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> What does your satisfaction concern me?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> I entreat this of you!—Do you wish to keep
me in incessant torments?—Would you force me to proceed
to extremities?—recollect that cases may occur
when the commission of an apparent crime, is in reality to
perform an act of virtue.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Contemptuously.</i>) Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> And should I ever perceive the slightest ground
for suspicion that thou wert capable of betraying Cora—observe,
Rolla, though I respect and honour thee, yet I assure
thee both by my God, and thy own, that I would take
thy life without remorse.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> I will not swear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Rolla, I entreat it once more!—What am I
to think of this refusal?—See how I am shaken to my very
soul—every limb trembles—my veins swell—and I can
scarcely breathe for anguish. In mercy then swear.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> I will not swear.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Drawing his sword in a rage, and pressing upon
Rolla.</i>) Die then!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Catching him hastily by the arm</i>) Is reason
again gone astray?—Hold! hold!—are you a knight?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Stand off, or my sword shall dispatch thee also!
(<i>He struggles to break away from Don Juan, while Rolla
continues immoveable and unconcerned.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> This storm of passion is too mighty for me!—I
can restrain him no longer—Rolla, defend thyself!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Seek not to restrain him, I die willingly for
Cora! (<i>During this scene Cora recovers from her swoon,
and as she opens her eyes perceives the struggle. She starts up
with the wildest anguish, rushes hastily down the hill, and
throws herself into Rolla’s arms.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Alonzo, what would you do?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> It is for thee!—for thy sake alone!—Should he
betray thee, we are lost.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> He betray me!—Rolla, my truest friend betray
me!—He who was ever my defender, my intercessor,
while I was yet a child,—who has so many times softened
my mother’s rage when I had offended her!—Oh Rolla,
you must remember it well?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> But too well!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> And do you think that he would betray me?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Why then did he refuse the oath I required?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Had you cause sufficient to require an oath?—Look
at those eyes!—are they not a stronger security
for his faith than any oath?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Clasping her to his bosom.</i>) Now let me die!—Let
me, oh ye gods, die this very moment!—I am so
happy;—so blessed!—Cora reposes confidence in me, I
clasp her in my arms, I hear her voice once more!—Ah,
five years have elapsed since I experienced such happiness,
since I saw her except at an awful distance.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Earnestly.</i>) And I rejoice no less to see you
again so near me!—In your presence all the happy days of
my childhood seem to pass anew before my eyes—so many
delightful images are present to my recollection.——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Leaning upon his sword, and betraying emotions
of the most poignant jealousy</i>) Cora, what torments do you
inflict upon me!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Why are you tormented?—Oh you do not
know how strong an affection I bear for Rolla!—When a
youth he loved me, and we were destined for each other.—Yes,
Rolla, is it not true that we were destined for each
other?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Oh true, true indeed!—for your virtuous mother—but
no more—had she not died so prematurely—who
knows—</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Ah, dearest Alonzo, at that time I was continually
turning his love into ridicule, because I knew not what
it was to love. Forgive me, Rolla, I know it better now!
Oh how often, and how grievously must I have tormented
you!—</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Grievously!—most grievously!—but let that
be forgotten—this moment is so truly blessed!—</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Hear him, Alonzo, hear what kindness is breathed
in every word he utters!—but my mother always told me the
same—“<i>Rolla</i>,” she repeatedly said, “<i>has one of the best of
hearts—love him—marry him,—and I shall die happy</i>.”—But
when she died, Rolla was engaged in fighting his sovereign’s
battles, and during his absence a sacred flame was
kindled in my bosom.—At his return, therefore, I could
not love him; my heart was devoted to my God, and I
only sighed for the day when I should be wedded to the
Sun.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> But this romantic enthusiasm has at length
given way to nature, and love has found its way to your
heart?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Yes, Rolla, that once insensible heart is insensible
no longer—be you my confident.—I love that young
man; our first meeting was in the Temple of the Sun,
when I saw him standing by the side of our king.—My
heart was instantly overpowered with an emotion for which
I could scarcely account, and the dish that contained the
bread of sacrifice, almost fell from my trembling hand.
An ardent glance which he cast upon me, soon gave me
assurance that my feelings were not unanswered on his
part—yet since I was shut up within the boundaries of the
Temple, and he could only steal round the outward walls,
what hope remained that we might ever find the means of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
personally communicating our mutual passion. The gods
saw and pitied our distress.—You must well remember that
awful day, some months ago, when the hills around burst
out with flames of fire,—when the ocean raged, and the
earth trembled,—when many palaces were laid in ruins,—when
even the Temple of the Sun itself was menaced with
destruction, and the walls by which it is surrounded were
rent asunder in two separate places. Then, trembling, and
weeping, we poor affrighted servants of the gods ran hither
and thither—death seemed to reign triumphant in our cells—he
seemed still to pursue us when we fled under the roof
of heaven alone, and our shrieks were mingled with the
groans of contending nature. Alonzo, ever on the watch
among these bushes, soon perceived the breach in the wall,
and boldly ventured to ascend it—one stone after another
fell beneath his feet—here the earth gaped to swallow him
up, and there my arm was stretched out to receive him.—The
darkness veiled our love from observation; and since
that time my Alonzo has frequently found his way over the
same ruins.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Cora, I tremble for thee!—In what dreadful
perils hast thou involved thyself!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Tell him all!—let him know the fatal consequence
of <i>your</i> weakness, and <i>my</i> guilt!—tell him—</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Yes, Rolla, it is true.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> What!—how!—Oh thoughtless girl!—And
you, Alonzo, were you so ignorant of our customs that—ye
gods!—ye gods!—my children you must fly!—instantly
fly!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> But whither?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Ah, Rolla, save her!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Terrified</i>) Is this really esteemed so high a
crime here below, altho’ the gods above do not regard it
as an offence.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> How much my whole frame is shaken with horror!—I
am at this moment scarcely capable of thought!—Cora,
do you love him?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> As my own soul.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> And are you certain that in his arms repentance
will never corrode your peace, but that you can live and
die contentedly as his wife?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> ’Tis all I wish.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> And do you, Alonzo, feel the value of the sacrifice
she would make you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> I feel it deeply.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Then will I save you both. (<i>He places himself
between them</i>) Come hither, and each give me a hand!—Consider
me as your brother—as such, Cora, my dearest
sister, I unite you to this man. (<i>Placing her hand in
Alonzo’s</i>) May the shade of your mother, which hovers
over us at this moment, look down with an eye of favour
upon your union!—May it be followed by her blessing—If
you are happy, I shall be so. (<i>He turns aside, and wipes
tears from his eyes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Alonzo and Cora.</i> (<i>Throwing their arms round him</i>)
Our dearest brother!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Yes, your brother!—and as your brother, will
I pass the remainder of my days with you. In a sequestered
spot, on the other side of the blue mountains, lives a friend
of mine, an old Cazique, who, under the monarch of
Cuzco, rules a mild and gentle race, many of whom served
in their sovereign’s army during the last war. At that
time the son of the Cazique, a youth of the fairest promise,
was severely wounded, and fell a prisoner into my
hands; but, by my care and attention, he soon recovered of
his wounds, and I restored him, without ransom, to his
father. Since that moment the good man has been unbounded
in his expressions of gratitude—He will receive
us with transport; and in that remote province your love
will find a secure asylum. There will I live with you,—tend
and educate your children—be cheerful and happy,
since Cora will be happy;—and at last, amid your brotherly
and sisterly tears, quit this world with calmness and serenity,
and ascend with transport to our Father above.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Where you will be received by my mother with
inexpressible transports of gratitude!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Noble, generous man!—Scarcely dare I raise
my eyes towards you!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Half aside, endeavouring to conceal a tear</i>) By
all the saints above, if that man be not a Christian, I myself
will turn Heathen!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Let us now consult together what further is to
be done!—Flight is resolved on; but the time and manner
of its accomplishment remain to be considered.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>Who, during this whole scene has been looking
about in different places, to see that all was safe, now comes
forward hastily.</i>) I hear a rustling noise behind the walls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
and sounds which appear like the whispering of two female
voices.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Hasten, hasten into my cave! (<i>As they are going
Idali and Amazili appear coming through the breach in the
wall, and looking about with great eagerness and curiosity.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE IV.—<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Idali</span> and <span class="smcap">Amazili</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> We are too late, they are here already!</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> Cora! we were looking for you.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I am coming.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Tarry a moment!—They have seen and heard
us,—for God’s sake! do not let them escape thus; we
must win them over to our interest.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> That were a task for a minister of state!—If
this be accomplished, I shall be persuaded that Rolla is capable
of conquering whole provinces, without a stroke of
the sword.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Nothing more easy!—Flatter them, they are
women.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Lovely maidens! will you not come near?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> (<i>To Amazili</i>) I believe he means to address us.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> How he fixes his eyes upon us!—Let us
hasten back.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> Come, Cora, the High-Priestess sent us to seek
for you.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Pray come nearer, pious virgins!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> And receive the homage due to your charms.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> (<i>To Amazili.</i>) Shall we run away?</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> Yes; let us fly. (<i>Neither of them stir.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I will go with you directly. But why do you
stand there so bashfully among the trees?—Come here,
sisters.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> Oh no, not among men.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Men!—Fair maidens! how came you to suppose
us men? Three of us are only Spaniards, and the
other will readily withdraw, if you wish to avoid his presence.
(<i>He makes a sign to Rolla, who immediately retires
into the entrance of his cave.</i>) Are you still afraid, sweet
maidens?</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> (<i>To Idali</i>) What do you think,—shall we
venture?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> You step first, and I will follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> No, you are the oldest.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> But you got over the wall first.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> Yes; but it was you that first spied the
breach.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> The contest may easily be decided. (<i>He steps
between them, and draws them both after him</i>) Now you
may safely swear that neither took the first step.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> Ah, Idali! he has laid such fast hold of me!</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> And of me too!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Be quiet, dear children! no harm shall happen
to you. (<i>He chucks Idali under the chin</i>) You are
blooming as a rose. (<i>Turning to Amazili</i>) And you, as—as—as—</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>With great gallantry</i>) As a sun-flower.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>To Idali</i>) Your eyes are so soft and blue.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>To Amazili</i>) Yours are so very roguish.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> You smile so sweetly.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> The coral of your lips is so alluring.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> This hand is so soft.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> This waist is so slender.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> (<i>To Idali</i>) Shall we run away?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> I think we may as well stay a little.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> But are you certain that you are not men?—We
must die if you deceive us.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Come, sisters, we shall be missed.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> And then the High-Priestess will scold.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> We ought to be dressing for the festival.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> And there is nobody in the temple—the sacred
flame will be extinguished.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> You can easily kindle it again with your bright
eyes.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Tell me, Idali, how happened it that the High-Priestess
sent you hither?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> We repaired to the temple this morning to take
your place, and not finding you there, we went and reported
it to the High-Priestess, who immediately sent us to
look for you in the garden.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Did she give you no further orders?</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> Only when we found you, to send you to her.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> And should she ask where you met with Cora,
what will you answer?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> That we found her talking with some Spaniards.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Oh you must not mention us, sweet girls! for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
the High-Priestess will be angry at your staying so long,
and forbid your meeting us again—and you would like, I
hope, to come here sometimes, and amuse us with your
conversation.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> (<i>To Amazili</i>) I have fallen so desperately in
love with you, my little rogue, that I hope you will come
and meet me again.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> (<i>To Idali</i>) What do you say, Idali?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> I can’t tell.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Say rather that Cora had fallen asleep behind one
of the pillars in the temple, and in the dusk of morning you
did not perceive her.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Or that she was lying under the shade of the
great palm-tree, in the court before the temple.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> Oh charming!</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> An excellent thought!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Come, let us hasten back.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> It is indeed time; let us go.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> Yes, let us go. (<i>Neither she nor Idali stir</i>)</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Go sweet maiden.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Go you little rogue.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> Well, good morning—good morning.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> Farewel—farewel. (<i>They return over the
wall</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Embracing Alonzo</i>) Farewel, Alonzo!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Farewel, my beloved—soon my wife. <span class="exit">[<i>Exit Cora.</i></span></p>

<h3>SCENE V.—<i>Re-enter <span class="smcap">Rolla</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Well, how have you managed them?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Most completely—we have wound them round
our fingers.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Rolla knows their sex.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> By report chiefly.</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> I begin to like the adventure extremely—my
little creature seemed disposed to be very loving.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Yet the clouds, so pregnant with thunder, every
moment gather thicker over our heads, and wear a more
menacing aspect.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Taking Rolla’s hand</i>) Brother!—dearest brother
hasten to extricate us!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> I must consider the matter more calmly.—Oh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
what new vigour have my limbs acquired!—I am become
quite another man. No longer are all things indifferent
to me; I find something again to interest me in the world;
I can again hope and fear, desire and reject.—Thanks to
thee, Cora, for the mild rain which has thus revived the
withered plant. Yes, we will fly!—Flight may be dangerous,
but I shall find it therefore the more grateful.
When our pursuers shall be so close upon us, that their
cries assail our ears, and their arrows fly around us, then
shall I be inspired with new life. When Rolla shall fight
for Cora—when he shall brandish his sword in her defence,
then will be, indeed, the moment for displaying the full extent
of his powers. I was called valiant under the walls
of Cuzco, and in the fields of Tumibamba; but then I
did not fight for Cora—did not fight under her eyes!—In
that situation I shall become a god!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Falling on his neck</i>) Exalted man!—Deign to
give me but one friendly glance as an assurance that you
have pardoned the headstrong boy!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> No, Alonzo, I would not have more merit
ascribed to me than I can justly claim. All that I do is for
Cora—nothing for you. Were she only to drop a withered
flower into the water, and express a wish to have it again,
I would instantly plunge into the stream to recover it for
her, even at the hazard of my life. It is for her sake alone
that I am your friend—for <i>her</i> sake that I pardon <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Yet permit me at least to cherish a hope, that
I may one day be thought worthy of a place in your friendship,
for my own sake.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> You are beloved by Cora, what more can you
wish. Oh! if Cora loved <i>me</i>, the gods themselves might
seek my friendship in vain!—But we are merely talking,
when we ought to be in action. Come into my cave,
there we shall be secure from listeners; there we can arrange
the plan of our escape, and carouse together unmolested;—for
to-day I am resolved to carouse—yes, even
to intoxication!—I am already intoxicated—intoxicated
with joy! From the crown of my head to the sole of my
foot, every atom of my frame is in a commotion of extacy.
My strength, my faculties, have acquired such additional
power, that at this moment I seem as if I could controul
the world! (<i>He takes Alonzo’s hand, and leads him into
his cave.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> (<i>Following them</i>) Happy is it for the king of
Quito that this man is in love. Either to love with such
unbounded passion, or to precipitate his sovereign from his
throne, seems to be the destination of such a mind. <span class="exit">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Drink, and carouse!—I am your man for that.—It
shall quickly be seen who can empty his glass, to the
honour of his girl, most frequently, and with the greatest
expedition. <span class="exit">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p>There, there, little Bibi!—You rogue you would
devour every thing!—These girls are gone a long time, I
suppose they are somewhere prattling together, upon some
trifling subject, till they forget how time goes.—Wait a
few minutes, Lulu,—your turn will come in time.—These
tedious creatures put me out of all patience, Heaven knows
what they are doing, they are as stupid as oysters, and as
slow as tortoises.—Come hither, Dudu,—there take this,
and give a bit to your wife—oh you little ingrate! you can
bite, can you.—This is too much!—the sun is already risen
above the hills, and they are not returned!—the giddy
creatures rely too much upon the mildness and gentleness
of my heart, don’t they Bibi?—I am too ready to overlook
a fault, am I not Lulu?—But locking them up for a

are you frightened?—And so you are absolutely here already?</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Why how now?—One of you have
uttered an untruth again. What is at the bottom of all
this?—Idali, do you remain where you are, and you, Amazili,
come with me. (<i>She leads her to the other side of the
Stage, and speaks in a half whisper</i>) Tell me truly, do
you come from the temple?</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Now don’t stir. (<i>She goes to Idali.</i>)
Amazili positively asserts that you come from the garden,
I can scarcely believe her—tell me the real truth.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> Oh yes, we come from the garden.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> So, so!—Some pretty trick has been
playing here, and I must sift out the truth as well as I can.
Idali, don’t stir from your corner.—And what is the meaning
of all this winking, and nodding, and shaking of the
head?—Keep your head still, and your eyes upon the
ground. (<i>She goes to Amazili</i>) Have you found Cora?</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Where did you find her?</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> She had fallen asleep under the large palm-tree
that stands before the porch of the temple.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Remain there, and don’t take your
eyes from the ground. (<i>She goes to Idali</i>) Have you
found Cora?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Where did you find her?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> Sitting behind a pillar in the temple, fast asleep.
We might have passed her twenty times without perceiving
her.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Admirable!—Now both of you come
hither. (<i>She takes a hand of each, and looks steadfastly first at
one, then at the other</i>) You have both uttered falsehoods!
You say that Cora was asleep behind a pillar in the temple,
and you that she was under the palm-tree in the court of
the temple. (<i>Idali and Amazili hem, and cough, and look
terrified and embarrassed</i>) Which am I to believe?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> (<i>To Amazili</i>) Silly girl, you have forgotten every
thing.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> No, it is you who have forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> No, indeed it is you.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> I am sure that I was bid to say under the
shade of the great palm-tree.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> I am sure I was bid to say behind the pillar.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> <i>I was bid!</i> and, <i>I was bid!</i>—What
may all this mean? (<i>Idali and Amazili hesitate</i>) If you
will not please to recollect yourselves now, I shall soon
find a way to assist your memories.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> (<i>To Amazili.</i>) This is your fault.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> No, it is your’s.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> I certainly did not mention him first.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> <span class="smcap">Him!</span>—who?—who?——Oh you
wicked girls, why you have not been among men I hope?—The
gods defend us from so horrible a misfortune!</p>

<p><i>Idali and Amazili.</i> Oh no!—no indeed!</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> No?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> They were not men.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> Only Spaniards.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Spaniards!—how?—what?—Spaniards!—(<i>She
pauses and somewhat recovers herself.</i>) Well,
well, if they really were only Spaniards?—And how many
might there be?</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> (<i>Growing pleased and communicative</i>) Three.
One for Cora, one for Idali, and one for me. Mine, had
fine brown hair, and eyes just the same colour.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> Mine had black curling hair, and such a sweet
countenance.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> But mine was the handsomest.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> No, mine was much handsomer.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Well, well, this may be settled another
time. Now tell me how came these Spaniards in the
temple?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> They were not in the temple.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> What, then; had they flown over the
high walls into the garden?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> They were not in the garden.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> But they might have come in, as easily as we
got out.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> You got out of the garden?—and how
could that be managed?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> According to your orders we went to look for
Cora. We ran hither and thither, and called her by her
name, but to no purpose, till at last as we were looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
about, and listening, we thought we heard voices on the
other side of the wall, just by the arbour, where the little
stream is lost in the wood. We followed the sound, and
crept softly through the thick bushes, till at last we came to
a great, great rent in the wall, from the top, quite to the
bottom, and so broad that Amazili and I could easily go
through it, and we had only to step over a few stones to get
quite on the outside.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> And you did step over the stones and get
on the outside?</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> Else we should not have found Cora.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Indeed!—What, she too had stepped
over the stones?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> Yes, and was talking with the Spaniards. At
first we thought they were men, and were going to run
away, but they entreated us very earnestly to stay; and as
we found that they really were only Spaniards, we thought
there could be no harm in complying with them.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> And they wanted us to promise that we
would come again.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Which promise you made?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> We only half promised it.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> But you intend meeting them again?</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> What do you say, Idali?</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> Perhaps so, if you are inclined, Amazili.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Well, well, at present go and send
Cora hither—then dress yourselves, prepare the bread of
sacrifice, and dispose it in the baskets.</p>

<p><i>Idali.</i> (<i>Taking Amazili’s hand</i>) Come, sister, I have
such an inclination to dance.</p>

<p><i>Amazili.</i> And I could laugh and sing. (<i>Exeunt both.</i>)</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> (<i>Alone</i>) Dance, laugh, and sing, if you
please, your simplicity protects you from my anger;—but
you shall not find the breach in the wall again, that I promise
you. As for this, Cora—can the shameless creature
have been carrying on an intercourse with men?—Chaste
Oello, look down with compassion upon thy servants, and
avert from us this last of all calamities!—I have long observed,
that she has hung down her head—that her ruddy
cheeks have lost their colour—that she has appeared abstracted,
full of thought, and seemed scarcely to know with
whom she was speaking, or to hear when she was addressed.—All
this indicates no good, does it Dudu?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<h3>SCENE III.—<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Cora</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Shameless girl, do you dare to appear
in my presence?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I come from the service of our god.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Be thankful that his thunder is not
entrusted to my hands.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> What do you mean?—how have I incurred your
anger?</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Do you suppose that I am unacquainted
with your licentious conduct?—that I am ignorant how
Cora disgraces these sacred walls, and exposes her own, and
her sister’s honour to censure.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I have done nothing wrong.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Look stedfastly in my face,—you have
been in the company of men?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I have not offended the gods.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Cora, I command you to look at me!—you
are acquainted with a Spaniard?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I am innocent.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> This very morning you have seen and
conversed with him?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> The sun was witness of all my actions.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Confess your crime.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I have not been guilty of a crime.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Oh blinded, misguided creature!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> The path which I pursue, is that of nature and
innocence.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Obstinate girl!—But remember that
you are a priestess of the sun, and tremble at the torments
to which the severity of our laws destines those by whom
they are transgressed.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I shall suffer undeservedly.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> You will not confide in me?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Nor confess your fault?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> I admonish you for the last time,
Cora!—But a few moments remain, in which confession is
left to your choice—make your use of them. I know all—I
am instructed in every particular. Soon shall I assemble
the Virgins in the Temple, and convene thither the priests,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
who shall judge you, and by whom you will be judged
with severity. Death will then be your lot, and worse
than death, shame. At present we are alone,—do you persist
in silence?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> (<i>Changing her tone</i>) Enough, I cannot
believe Cora to be really so guilty. I knew your mother,
when you were yet a child, we had frequent intercourse
with each other.—“<i>My Cora</i>,” she would often
say, “<i>has a gentle and complying spirit, for which quality I
love her most tenderly.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Oh, she was always an affectionate mother!—All
the happiness of my life was buried in her grave.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> You have doubtless a sacred reverence
for her memory?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Can that be made a question!—Alas how many
are the tears which I have shed for her in secret.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> If such your affection, you surely
would not convict her of a falsehood, as she rests in her
grave. Must I be compelled to think that it was only the
blindness of maternal love which could ascribe to you this
gentle and complying disposition?—or will you convince
me that she was right in her judgment?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> She was right!</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Then prove it to me. The mother’s
friend has an undoubted claim upon the daughter’s confidence.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Ah me!—</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> The last words that were uttered by
her pallid lips, still vibrate in my ears. “<i>My child</i>” she
said, “<i>is young and inexperienced, should she ever want maternal
counsel, be it received from you!</i>”—She spoke,—with
her cold hands pressed mine, and expired. (<i>Cora betrays
symptoms of irresolution, and appears combating with herself.
The High-Priestess continues after a pause</i>) And your aged
and reverend father, when he gave you into my hands,
kissed you and said, “<i>Take her, she is a good girl, and will
not occasion you any trouble.</i>”—Afterwards, when he was
about to return home, when he gave you his last blessing,
while a tear trembled on his grey eye-lashes, what were
his parting words—“<i>Cora, honour her as a mother</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Falling at her feet</i>) I love!</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> (<i>Starting with horror</i>) You love?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I can no longer remain a priestess of the Sun!</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> No longer remain a priestess of the
Sun?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> But will marry.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Marry!—<i>you</i> marry!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> The gods have given me a feeling heart.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> To be devoted to their service.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I was born to become a wife.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> The Sun is your husband.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> To him I can offer only prayers and thanks;
but our heart and our love can be bestowed only on a husband.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Cora, recollect yourself, you are in a
dream.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I have now laid open my whole soul. If the
affection you bore the mother be indeed transferred to
the daughter, you will be my friend.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> And the person you love is a Spaniard?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> His name?—</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Is Alonzo.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> When, and where, did you first see him?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> In the Temple, by the side of our king.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> And what miracle brought you to a
nearer intercourse?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> The natural miracle which threatened the Temple
with destruction, and rent asunder the walls by which it is
enclosed.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Well, I must not know more, and let
what has passed be buried in eternal oblivion. To shew
you in how high regard I hold your mother’s memory, I
will preserve your secret inviolate, and you must by severe
repentance endeavour to avert the wrath of the gods.
Erase the image of Alonzo from your heart, forget his
smooth and deceitful tongue, think of him no more, but
attend to your employments and devotions.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> You certainly have never loved?</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> No, thanks be to the gods!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Had you ever felt one half of what I now feel,
you would have known that what you enjoin is no longer
in my power. Erase the image of Alonzo from my heart!—think
of him no more!—When I awake in the
morning, he is always the first object of my thoughts, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
at night when I lie down he is still the last.—When I kneel
in the temple, his name intrudes itself into my prayers,—when
I look at the image of the sun, I see only him,—and
when I would turn my thoughts to my God, I cannot detach
them from Alonzo.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> These are heavy offences, Cora!—You
must fast, pray, humble yourself.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I can pray for nothing but that the gods may
grant me Alonzo. Love is so soft, so exquisite a sensation
that it never can be sinful.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Sinful!—It is to be held in the utmost
abhorrence.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Are <i>you</i> then so entirely free from all emotions of
this passion.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> I am wholly devoted to the gods.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> In this assertion you either deceive me or yourself.
Do I not often see how tenderly you nurse and feed
these birds,—taking, now this, now that, out of the cage,
setting it on your finger, stroaking it, kissing it, talking
to it?</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Poor little creatures, to love them is
such an innocent affection.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> And my love is equally innocent.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Love for a man!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> The feeling is still the same!—the heart must
love!—a turtle-dove engages your affections,—am I to
blame if mine are fixed on other objects.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Do not deceive yourself, Cora. Is it
a matter of indifference, whether you employ the sacred
flame only in consuming the sacrifice, or use it to set the
temple on fire?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I do not comprehend your simile, my heart speaks
in a plain and simple manner. I always thought that love
must be pleasing to the gods, I have made the experiment,
and the event has justified my opinion. The gods cannot
be offended with me; for say, good mother, when Cora
serves in the temple, does a sudden gloom overcast the
heavens, does the sun conceal himself behind a cloud?</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> No, your guilty course has been
pursued only in darkness—the rays of the great light have
never witnessed your crimes.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Yes, they also have witnessed my love. On this
very morning I solemnly embraced Alonzo in the presence
of the sun himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> (<i>With a start of horror</i>) Embraced
Alonzo?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Pressed my lips, my breast, to his.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Your lips—your breast!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> And our god smiled upon us.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> No more, unhappy girl!—Go and
conceal yourself before I repent that I made you a promise
of secrecy. It is not <i>your</i> honour alone that is concerned
in this affair, it is the honour of our whole order.—Go,
and settle as well as you can with your heart, whether it
may find the extinction of your passion pleasing, or displeasing;
only of this be allured, that you must see Alonzo no
more.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Resolutely</i>) I will no longer remain a priestess
of the sun.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Vain resolution!—Death only can release
you from his service.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> But you say that I am criminal.—Well, then,
I am no longer worthy to serve the sun. If however I
devote to him in my place, an innocent creature, pure and
free from sin, will not this be pleasing to him, shall I not
then have discharged my duty, and be released from my oath.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> I do not understand you.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> The innocent creature which I bear within me
shall be devoted to the sun. (<i>The High-Priestess starts
back, attempts to speak, but is unable; she totters and is obliged
to support herself against a chair</i>) What is the matter?—Have
you misunderstood me?—The innocent creature
which I bear within me shall be devoted to the sun.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> (<i>Running about in a phrenzy</i>) Idali!—Amazili!—Runa!—Ye
daughters of the Sun, hasten
hither!—Ah!—I cannot support myself!—(<i>She sinks down
upon a chair</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE IV.—<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Idali</span>, <span class="smcap">Amazili</span>, and several other
<span class="smcap">virgins of the sun</span> from different parts.</i></h3>

<p><i>All talking together.</i> What is the matter?—What has
happened?—She is in a swoon!—Cora, tell us what is the
matter?—What has thrown her into this agitation?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>With great composure</i>) I do not know.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> (<i>Recovering</i>) Hasten, ye daughters of
the Sun, shut up this sacrilegious creature in our darkest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
dungeon, that the rays of our god may not be profaned by
falling upon a being so contaminated. You Runa, and
Odila must answer with your lives for the prisoner, till the
moment when she shall be brought forth to judgment.
The rest of you veil yourselves in the deepest mourning,
and follow me to the royal palace. The Sun is incensed
against us!—the wrath of the gods has lighted upon us!—heavy
sins are to be answered!—curses must fall upon Peru,
and the avenging arm of the powers above will pursue us
into the most secret places. Hasten!—extinguish the sacred
light in the temple, tear down the wreaths of flowers,
no festival can now be solemnized, this day is changed
into a day of mourning!—Let us repair to the foot of
the throne to demand vengeance, dreadful vengeance against
the criminal! (<i>She rushes out, a confused noise and murmuring
is made by all present who all at once question Cora</i>)</p>

<p><i>All.</i> What have you done, Cora?—Tell us?—Tell
us?—</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I have done nothing wrong. (<i>Exit with composure.</i>)</p>

<p><i>All.</i> (<i>As they follow her</i>) Look well to her!—Take
care that she does not escape!—Your lives must answer it!
Away—away! (<i>Exeunt.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE V.—<i>A large hall in the king’s palace, with
guards ranged on each side. Enter the <span class="smcap">King’s Chamberlain</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Chamberlain.</i> (<i>To the Guards</i>) Throw open the doors!—Let
all enter, who are come hither on this solemn day
of festival to salute their sovereign the first-born of the
sun, and conduct him to the temple. As soon as the
king shall be arrayed in his Inca’s robes, he will appear
himself.</p>

<h3>SCENE VI.—<i>The doors are thrown open. Enter the
<span class="smcap">High-Priest</span>, <span class="smcap">Xaira</span>, <span class="smcap">Don Alonzo</span>, <span class="smcap">Don Juan</span>,
with a long train of priests and courtiers. Many compliments
are exchanged on all sides; they walk about, and
converse in different groupes. Several of the courtiers
assemble round the chamberlain.</i></h3>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> (<i>To the High-Priest.</i>) Why do these strangers
come hither?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Probably to attend the king when he
goes to the sacrifice.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Oh impious, to permit the presence of strangers
at the celebration of our solemnities, perhaps only to make
them the subject of their mockery.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Mockery!—No, that were to shew themselves
fools, and I can rely upon that brave youth for not
being guilty of any folly. Have you forgotten that our
king is indebted to him for his life—that he has made the
people of Quito the terror of their enemies since he
taught them the mode of fighting practised in his country—that
he has also instructed us in many useful arts of
peace?</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Mere deception. He has only increased our
wants.—We were much happier without him.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Discontented man!</p>

<p><i>Chamberlain.</i> Gentlemen, do you know any news for
the entertainment of the king?</p>

<p><i>One of the Company.</i> None, excepting that old Telasco
arrived here yesterday evening from his province.</p>

<p><i>Another.</i> And has brought his son Zorai to present him
to the Inca.</p>

<p><i>Chamberlain.</i> How long is it since the venerable old
man last visited the capital?</p>

<p><i>First Speaker.</i> Two years. He has not been here since
he brought his daughter Cora to be consecrated as a
Priestess.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Starting, and speaking aside to Juan</i>) Velasquez,
do you hear that Cora’s father is in Quito?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Yes, I hear it.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> And her brother?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> I hear that too.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> This alone was wanting to make my misery
complete!—How will their unsuspecting features harrow
my conscience. (<i>Martial instruments are heard behind
the scene, playing a march.</i>)</p>

<p><i>All.</i> The king approaches.</p>

<h3>SCENE VII.—<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Ataliba</span> with his train. All
present prostrate themselves before the king.</i></h3>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>Addressing the High-Priest.</i>) I rejoice, good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
old man, to see how much your strength bears up beneath
the weight of years.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Under such a sovereign one cannot grow
old.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> For what I am. I have solely to thank you;
that I can never forget. (<i>To Xaira.</i>) It is a charming
day, Xaira, the gods are favourably disposed towards us.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> (<i>With hesitation</i>) Yet—unfavourable omens,
have disquieted my bosom.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> How so?</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> The lamb which I was about to sacrifice at
midnight, struggled beneath the sacred knife.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Most natural.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> And the lungs, which, when they tremble and
quiver after they are torn out, promise happiness for the
ensuing year, lay still and motionless.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> I thank you for the information, but I desire
that it may not be spread abroad among the people. (<i>To
the High-Priest, smiling and speaking in a half whisper.</i>)
We have tygers enough to annoy us, why should we tremble
before a lamb?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> To the people such a lamb is more formidable
than a tyger; and the king owes respect to popular
faith.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> True, good old man, for it was upon that
foundation that Manco-Capac erected his dominion.—(<i>Turning
to Alonzo.</i>) I rejoice, my beloved friend, to see
that you are still contented to live among us.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> How can I be otherwise, royal Inca, while you
continue to entertain me thus hospitably?</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Which I shall never cease to do, as long as I
behold you so worthy of my love. (<i>To Velasquez</i>) Well,
Don Juan, do the troops that you are training make a rapid
progress?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> They are brave fellows;—they have arms of
iron, and hearts of wax.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Oh that I could be certain of enjoying eternal
peace!—then should those nervous arms be devoted to
agriculture alone. (<i>Turning to the High-Priest.</i>) Is it
not time that we go to the Temple?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> We are all ready.</p>

<p><i>Chamberlain.</i> (<i>Approaching the king.</i>) Sire, the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Telasco, governor of the castle of Antis, is arrived, and
wishes to pay his homage to the first-born of the Sun.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> My worthy Telasco!—Let him come in.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Aside to Velasquez</i>) Oh Juan!—my heart!
my heart!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Do not betray yourself.</p>

<h3>SCENE VIII.—<i>On a signal from the Chamberlain, the
Guards open the door, when <span class="smcap">Telasco</span>, and <span class="smcap">Zorai</span>, enter.</i></h3>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>Meeting and embracing Telasco.</i>) Welcome
venerable old man!—What brings you from your enviable
solitude into the bustle of a court? (<i>Calling to the
Attendants.</i>) Let a seat be brought.</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> Suffer me to stand, good Inca. It is the posture
which best becomes a petitioner.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Has Telasco any request to make?—Speak then.</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> Two years ago I brought my daughter here,
to devote her, according to her own desire, to the service of
the gods. I cannot deny that the parting with her was
a severe trial to me, for I had long been accustomed to
enjoy her innocent society, and ever since the death of my
wife, when I fell into ill health, had been nursed and attended
by her with the tenderest care and affection. It may
be supposed, therefore, that we did not separate without
many tears on both sides. My son, at that time a youth,
was then the only treasure remaining—he is now grown
up to manhood, and as his sister is devoted to the gods, I
would devote him to the service of his country. To you,
great king, I present him—be you his father when I am
gone!—I do not doubt that he will conduct himself worthily—I
have no fear he will ever forget that the blood of
the Incas flows through his veins. Accept my present with
favour!—I bring you the greatest treasure that I possess
upon earth!—I bring you my all!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> He shall be my own son!—Come hither, young
man. (<i>Zorai kneels to him</i>) Inherit thy father’s virtues,
and thou shalt be heir to thy father’s honours.</p>

<p><i>Zorai.</i> Pardon my silence. Time only can decide
whether or no I shall deserve such favour.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Rise!—Alonzo, I consign him to thy care.

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Embarrassed</i>) Oh king! I will endeavour to
gain his confidence.</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> (<i>To Alonzo</i>) Art thou the man in whom the
people bless the saviour of their Inca? Permit these
old arms to embrace thee! (<i>He embraces Alonzo</i>) Thy
fame has reached to the remotest parts of this nation—thy
name is repeated with transport by our children’s children!—Happy
is my son in being placed under such a leader.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Extremely embarrassed and affected</i>) He shall
be my brother.</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> (<i>To Ataliba</i>) To your goodness am I indebted
that the last moments of my life are made thus happy.
Accept my grateful thanks!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i>A solemn march is heard playing at a distance</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Now, my children, let us repair to the temple!—Come,
Telasco, go on my right hand, and should you
find the walk fatiguing, let me be your support!—Ah,
how often have you supported me!</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> Blessings on you worthy, Inca!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i>As they are preparing to go, the music, which had continued
gradually to advance nearer, suddenly stops</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>Starting</i>) What means this?</p>

<p><i>Chamberlain.</i> (<i>Rushing in trembling, and almost breathless</i>)
Sire, the High-Priestess of the Sun approaches, with
a long train of priestesses all clad in mourning, and uttering
dreadful lamentations. Their cries pierce the very
soul; while the people gather round them trembling, and
observing them with silent awe and terror. (<i>The whole
assembly appear in the utmost confusion; the king alone preserves
his composure</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Conduct them hither.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Aside to Juan</i>) Oh God, Velasquez, what
can this portend!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> You tremble, and look pale;—for shame; rouse
yourself; shew yourself a man!</p>

<h3>SCENE IX.—<i>Enter the <span class="smcap">High-Priestess</span>, followed by
a long train of <span class="smcap">Virgins of the Sun</span>. They are clad
in thick mourning veils, and march in slow and solemn
procession towards the King. An awful silence is observed
by the whole company, who wait the sequel of the scene
with anxious expectation.</i></h3>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> (<i>Throwing back her veil</i>) Oh woe!
woe! woe!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> On whom dost thou imprecate woe?</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> The temple is polluted!—the altars are
profaned!—the holy lamp is extinguished!—Oh woe!
woe! woe!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Name the criminal, that the gods may be
avenged for these heavy offences.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> First born of the Sun, let the stringed
instruments, let the festal song, cease!—Let the temple be
divested of its ornaments, and the garlands be taken from
the beasts prepared for sacrifice; to-day can no festival
be solemnized!—Lamentations must be our only songs,
mourning veils our only ornaments!—A serpent has with
his poison polluted the house of the Stars!—A Virgin of
the Sun has broken her vow of chastity! (<i>She pauses a
few moments—the whole assembly shudder—Alonzo appears
like one thunderstruck—at length the High-Priestess proceeds</i>)
Woe! woe! upon <span class="smcap">Cora</span>!!!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i>At the mention of this name the <span class="smcap">King</span> utters a cry of
agony.—<span class="smcap">Telasco</span>, trembling, supports himself upon his staff—<span class="smcap">Zorai</span>,
full of confusion, conceals his face in his garments—<span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>
is sinking to the ground, but is supported by Velasquez—A
confused murmur is heard among the rest of the
assembly.</i>)</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Vengeance! vengeance! upon the murderer
of virtue!—upon the wretch who could abuse the hospitality
of a peaceable people, and violate the sacred asylum
of the Wives of the Sun!—Woe! woe! upon <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>!!!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i><span class="smcap">Ataliba</span> utters a more piercing cry than before—<span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>
stands with downcast eyes, while a death-like paleness
overspreads his countenance—The attention of the whole
company is immediately turned towards him—<span class="smcap">Telasco</span>
looks around with a vacant stare.</i>)</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> First born of the Sun!—image of our
God upon earth!—I stand here, and require from thee an
awful atonement for this sacrilege!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>With deep gloom</i>) Which thou shalt have.</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> Be death and shame the lot of the seducer!—Be
death and shame the lot of Cora, and her whole
family!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i><span class="smcap">Telasco</span> starts, murmurs to himself the word</i> “shame,”
<i>and falls to the ground—<span class="smcap">Zorai</span> throws himself by him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> All-merciful God! (<i>Calls to the attendants</i>)
Come to the assistance of this poor old man. (<i>Telasco is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
raised up—the High-Priestess is about to proceed, but the
King makes her a sign to be silent, and addresses her and her
train</i>) Enough, ye pious women! I know my duty, and
will perform whatever may be required by the ordinances
of Manco-Capac. To question you, Alonzo, concerning
the truth of the charge alledged against you, were needless;—thy
death-like countenance, thy downcast eyes
confess the fault too plainly, and thou art lost beyond the
possibility of redemption.—Hadst thou excited my provinces
to rebel against me; had thy sword deprived me of
half my kingdom, I would have given thee my hand, and
said, thou didst once save my life, and all that I have I share
willingly with thee!—But now, the king alone must speak;
the friend must remain silent.—Alonzo, thou art lost beyond
the possibility of redemption!—Unhappy youth, what
hast thou done!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Let me die!—Death is no more than I justly
deserve, for having repaid with such base ingratitude the
unmixed happiness I have enjoyed in this kingdom. Yes,
let me die, oh king! (<i>Falling upon his knees</i>) But save,
save, the hapless Cora!—she is innocent!—her seducer
only is guilty!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Rise!—My power is confined within certain
limits: and in no respect is it so rigidly circumscribed as in
all matters which concern religion. (<i>He stands for some
moments wrapt in mournful musing, and apparently struggling
with himself, then says, with averted countenance</i>) Guards,
put him in irons! (<i>To the High-Priest</i>) Assemble your
priests in the court of the temple, to judge the culprits
according to our holy laws and customs; and ere the sun
sink into the ocean, let me be summoned to confirm the
sentence. (<i>Going</i>)</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Sire, it is necessary the father and brother
should also be put in irons.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Poor old man!—he will not run away from
you!</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> The brother at least.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Well, if it must be!—(<i>Zorai is put in irons</i>)
Oh what misery is it to be king when one is compelled to
punish! (<i>Exit</i>)</p>

<p><i>High-Priestess.</i> (<i>To the High-Priest</i>) Hasten, thou first
servant of our gods, hasten to avenge your masters, that
this very evening the last rays of the declining sun may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
beam upon the grave which encloses Cora—Go, ye
daughters of the sun, bow yourselves down in prayer, wash
the altar with your tears, and conceal your blushing cheeks
beneath sevenfold veils, till the disgrace with which our
Order has been branded by that profligate stranger, be
wholly effaced!—(<i>Exit, followed by the Virgins of the Sun</i>)</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>Aside</i>) Poor Rolla! (<i>Exit</i>)</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> (<i>To some of the other Priests</i>) Go out at the
northern gate, and prepare a grave in that waste and
desolate spot which is distinguished by numerous heaps of
stones.</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> And let me be the first laid within it! <span class="exit">[<i>Exeunt Priests.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> (<i>To the Guards</i>) Lead the prisoners away.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>To Juan</i>) Farewel, Velasquez!—When you
return to our native country, bear my tenderest greetings
to my poor mother; but be careful to conceal from her my
unhappy story.</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> (<i>As he is seized by the guards</i>) Whither would
you drag me, old as I am?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Oh, Velasquez, this old man!—this unfortunate
old man!</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> Give me my daughter!—restore me my
daughter!</p>

<h3>SCENE II.—<i><span class="smcap">Diego</span> enters in great haste, and extreme
agitation. <span class="smcap">Rolla</span> stops on seeing him.</i></h3>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Ha!—Surely I recollect you, my friend!—Were
not you also present at my late interview with
Alonzo?—Tell me then what has happened since he departed
hence?—speak!—instantly speak?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> See, I tremble in every limb. My poor unfortunate
master!—Ah, he languishes in chains!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> And Cora?—Cora?</p>

<p><i>Diego.</i> Probably shares his fate.—Don Juan must know
more, for he was present during the whole scene.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Don Juan!—I thank you for mentioning his
name!—Where is he?—hasten, hasten to seek him!—Conduct
him hither instantly!—I will wait here to receive
him.—Begone, I entreat you!—the moments are
precious! (<i>Exit Diego</i>) My agony is intolerable!—I am
impatient to know all, yet tremble at the thoughts of
what I may hear!—I can scarcely breathe for anguish!—Uncle,
uncle, where are you? (<i>Going</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<h3>SCENE III.—<i>Enter the <span class="smcap">High-Priest</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Ha!—here he is!—Oh tell me instantly, whether
this be true or false?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Your words are scarcely intelligible, yet
the wildness of your looks explains them but too clearly.—Alas!
it is true!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Pointing to the grave</i>) And here?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>With a deep sigh, and turning away his
face</i>) Yes!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Tremble then, oh earth, and let thy whole surface
become desolate!—Groan! groan! ye hills!—Thou
fire burst forth in the valleys and consume the fruits of the
soil, that the fertile spots may no longer be crowned with
verdure, but the whole earth appear as one vast scene of
conflagration!—Rise ye terrors of nature, ye storms and
whirlwinds, that I may breathe more freely amid your
mighty conflicts,—that the voice of my agony may contend
with your roarings!—that my arm may slay more rapidly
than the lightning itself!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Rolla, for the sake of all the gods!—</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> No, she shall not die!—sooner shall the sacred
lamp be extinguished, and the temple itself become a desert!—Believe
me, Uncle, she shall not die!—you may tell me
that the grave is already prepared—that her fate is inevitable!—Yes,
it is prepared, but Rolla still lives!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Your words are of dreadful import!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Sooner shall it be Rolla’s grave!—sooner shall
he be stretched upon the earth, senseless, motionless, a
breathless corpse!—Yet let him not even then be trusted
hastily!—examine carefully that every spark of life be
really extinguished, since if only one be left smothering, it
will assuredly burst forth into a flame, and consume the
persecutors of Cora. Oh, while this hand can wield a
sword, let no one venture to touch Cora!—the blood of
him who should harbour so sacrilegious a thought, shall
answer for his rashness!—the priests—the king—even
thou thyself.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Madman rage on!—dare in thy phrenzy
to raise thy arm against the gods!—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Against the gods!—No, the gods are on my
side, their lightning is in my hand, their shield before my
breast!—Short-sighted mortals!—What are the brightest,
warmest rays of our god but pure effusions of that benign
love which alike unfolds the rose-bud, and expands the human
heart. Woe then to the miserable wretch who remains
insensible to its genial influence, and pining in a cold
damp corner of the earth lives a life scarcely superior to the
senseless oyster. Cora even excels her former self, since
she has yielded to this impulse;—and how could she fail to
do so, for the gods would never leave their master-piece
unfinished; and what is the heart without love, but a lamp
without light, an eye without the power of vision?——These
are things, Uncle, which however <i>you</i> cannot understand.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> You do me injustice, Rolla.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Injustice!—You cannot have been yourself susceptible
of the exquisite, the heavenly, feeling of love, when
it is your lips that have condemned Cora.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> You are right now—it was my <i>lips</i> condemned
her.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> But not your heart?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Not my heart.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Come then to my arms;—I rejoice to find that
you are a man!—But why stand here so cold and inactive?—fly
and save her!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> That is impossible.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Courage, dear Uncle, courage!—Your grey
hairs, your mild eloquence, my sword, and the arm of
God!—all these united—Yes, yes, we will save her!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Alas, young man, zeal blinds you to the
steep rocks which lie in our way.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> I feel sufficient energy to defy them.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Ancient popular opinions—the customs
of whole centuries——</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Nature is older than these.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> But not more powerful.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Mere evasion.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Could I, by sacrificing the few short
years remaining of my life, redeem the hapless Cora’s, I
would instantly with firm and resolute step descend into this
vault.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Babble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Are these tears also babble?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Hypocrisy!—do not talk, but act.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> What can I do?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Raising his hands towards Heaven</i>) Oh Father
above, do thou then interpose to save her!—suffer not the
most perfect work upon which thy rays ever shone to be
destroyed, but, to the confusion of these unfeeling priests,
save her!—Oh, how could I expect to find a heart of sensibility
within such a shell!—the heart that beats beneath
those garments never can have any feeling, except for vain
and senseless customs; it dissembles towards its god, and
is blood-thirsty as a tyger’s.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Oh Rolla, you know not how much you
wrong me!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Carefully instructed by your fathers and mothers
to pluck every flower which might lie in your way,—to
wring the neck of every bird which might fall into your
hands,—from your infancy each avenue in your hearts has
been closed against humanity, while he, who could with the
greatest composure perform such ignoble actions, was considered
as bearing in his bosom the germs of the future
High-Priest.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> This from you, Rolla?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Beloved and pampered self is the sole object of
your attention,—beauty is to you as a blunted arrow—and
love appears an absurd romance. A shake of the head is
the utmost tribute you can pay to the sufferings of a brother,
nor does the tear of sympathy ever <i>start</i> into your
eyes, it only quivers there by compulsion. No emotion of
concern would intrude into your breast were the world itself
to be laid in ruins, provided <i>you</i> were spared and could
continue to live in case and affluence.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Rolla, you torture me—you break my
heart!—I must speak out and shame you.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Yes, speak!—that also you can do sometimes—not
always.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Learn to be silent when an old man would
be heard, and if you cannot respect my age, at least respect
my misfortunes. Is the station in which I am placed that
of my own free choice?—are not the nearest relations of
the king priests by birth?—am I to blame because the caprice
of chance destined me to the altar, to immolate turtle-doves,
to draw omens from the entrails of lambs, and to interpret<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
dreams?—Oh had you known me in my youth, you
would have seen me full of ardour and energy,—more
eager to brandish the sword, than to wield the knife of sacrifice!—Believe
me, there are but few persons in the world
placed in the situations for which they are most suited, least
of all those who hold an office by descent.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>In a cold and constrained manner</i>) If I have said
too much, pardon me. Overpowered as I am with rage
and anguish, scarcely do I know myself.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Had it been possible to throw aside this
dignity with which I am reproached, as one casts off a
tight and uneasy garment, I had spurned it a thousand,
and a thousand times; for it has occasioned me forty years
of the bitterest suffering. Rolla, Rolla, I cannot endure
the chilling frown upon thy countenance; the eye of contempt
with which I am regarded!—Thou the only being
on whom my heart still hangs!—thou only being whose
affections I still wish to attract!—listen, Rolla, to my tragic
story—a story nearly resembling thine own!—My sorrows,
like thine, proceeded from the heart—my sorrows arose
from an ill-fated passion—I too loved a Virgin of the Sun!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> How!!!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> By virtue of my office as High-Priest, I
had at all times free ingress and egress, to and from the
house of the Stars. Daily did my eyes rove about among
the expanding blossoms that were confined within its walls,
and I was pleased with contemplating their varied charms,
though this long remained a mere amusement to the eye,
while the heart took no share in the glances that I cast
around me. At length Zulma came, a meteor among
meteors; she shone in the midst of her sisters a brilliant
image of the god she served. I saw her often, and every
time I beheld her, only wished more ardently to see her
again—yet I continued insensible to the danger of my situation,
till I was one day accidentally led into a strict examination
of my heart, when I was terrified at the result.
My conduct with regard to Zulma was instantly changed;
I was no longer unrestrained in her presence; I scarcely
dared to raise my eyes to hers; and my whole frame trembled
as I approached her. I was soon convinced that her
heart beat responsively to mine, since she immediately began
to avoid me, as if too sensible of my meaning. I saw
that the effort was painful, that love and duty were at war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
in her bosom, and, desirous to render the conflict less severe,
I determined equally to avoid her. Many months
lingered on in this miserable situation, while both endured
the keenest torments of hopeless passion: our cheeks grew
pale; our eyes became hollow and sunk; despair reigned
in every feature; till at length Zulma’s weaker frame
could no longer support such complicated sorrow—she was
attacked with a violent illness, and lay at the point of
death; while I——Rolla, you seem affected!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Holding out his hand to him with averted eyes</i>)
Oh, how unjust have I been!—I am ashamed!—pardon
me!—and—proceed, Uncle—tell me she died!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> I hastened to her assistance—day and
night I climbed the most rugged rocks, or ranged the forests,
to seek medicinal herbs for her restoration. I summoned
together the oldest priests in the kingdom who were
celebrated for their skill in the medical science; and at
length, by our unwearied exertions, the lovely Zulma
was saved. She sunk in my arms overpowered with gratitude—not
a word was spoken by either, we explained
ourselves only by the expressive language of tears—(<i>He
appears extremely affected</i>) Oh, Rolla! I am now grown
old, yet see how the recollection of this scene still shakes me.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Clasping his hand eagerly</i>) Beloved, excellent
Uncle!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Stop till you hear the conclusion of my
story!—The long-smothered flame of love now burst out
with uncontroulable wildness—the voices of reason and
duty were listened to no longer—passion had gained the
sole ascendency in our bosoms—and——(<i>Rolla starts, and
fixes his eyes on the High-Priest, who spreads out his arms
towards him</i>) Rolla, you are my son!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>With the most eager emotion</i>) Old man, you mock me!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> You are indeed my son.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Throws himself into the High-Priest’s arms;
after a few moments, he breaks from him again hastily</i>) And
my mother—is she still alive?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> No—from above she looks down and
blesses this scene! (<i>Rolla stands with his arms folded, his
head sunk upon his bosom, and his eyes fixed upon the ground,
endeavouring to restrain his tears</i>) Think then how my
paternal heart has been tortured by your bitter revilings!—Understand
why I have always clung to you
with such ardent fondness!—why I have followed, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
every where, and interested myself so eagerly in your fate!—The
anxiety I expressed when I saw you depart to head
the armies of your sovereign, is now solved!—solved
equally are the transports by which I was overpowered
when I beheld you return as victor.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Falling on his neck</i>) Have I then ever communicated
the throb of transport to any human breast?—My
father!—Oh this name is so new to my tongue!—filial
feelings are so new to my heart!—How often, when at
the head of the army I have knelt to receive your priestly
blessing, have I felt your hand tremble as it was laid upon
me!—Oh, why did I not guess the cause of this tremor!—why
did I not know that it was a father’s blessing I knelt
to receive!—My father!—my father!—why have you
concealed yourself so long from your son?—why have you
not sooner communicated joy to a bosom to which it has
hitherto been a stranger?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Was it possible to trust the wildness and
ardour of thy youth?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> But all is not yet clear to me. Oh then unveil
the sequel of your story!—tell me—could you escape discovery?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> What would have been impossible to
another, was possible to me from my situation as High-Priest.
Our hapless adventure was never known; and as
soon as you were born, I sent you to the frontiers of the
kingdom, among the people of Ibara, of which province
my brother was governor. You were educated as his son;
but as he died while you were still a child, his death furnished
me with a pretence for removing you to Quito, that
I, as a near relation, might take you under my protection;
and, from that time, I have never ceased to pay as much
attention to your education myself, as I thought I might
do with safety, and without exciting suspicion. Your mother
had gone to the place of rest some months before your
arrival, and left me condemned for a long series of years
to drag about a miserable existence.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Miserable!—when you had a son!—I have
indeed hitherto considered my existence as miserable, because
I thought myself single and solitary in the world;
but never shall I think it so again, now I know that I have
a father living—a father who loves me, whose heart will
sympathize with mine. Yes, I am reconciled to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
world!—It is true, my father, that neither of us can be
perfectly happy; yet a life that shall be supportable, nay
in which you shall experience many hours of real enjoyment,
I dare promise you. Hear what golden visions my
fancy has formed:—Cora and Alonzo shall fly, we will
accompany them, and I will conduct you to one who, for
my sake, will be a friend to us all. There we will live,—there
pass the remainder of our days quietly, contentedly,
and free from cares;—and, my father, if sometimes
when I witness Cora’s and Alonzo’s caresses, and the
transports they mutually experience—if when—pierced to
the heart with the idea that Alonzo’s happiness might have
been mine, I cannot bear to be a spectator of the scene any
longer, I will make you a signal that we depart together,
and leave the lovers alone; then we will retire under the
shade of some neighbouring tree, and you shall soothe my
cruel feelings by talking to me of my mother.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> You do not consider, my son, that flight
is impossible. Cora and Alonzo are both in chains, and
both vigilantly guarded; nor will many hours elapse before
sentence is passed upon them by the assembled priests.
Do not then deceive yourself with vain hopes!—Cora is
irretrievably lost.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Oh do not tell me so!—I cannot bear to hear it!—she
must, she must be saved!—Are you not high-priest?—the
first among her judges?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> But what can the voice of one avail
against many?—against the storm of Xaira’s zeal?—We
may cry to the roaring winds till we are hoarse, and we
cannot hinder them from tearing up the young trees by the
roots.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> You will at least have done your part—God
and my sword shall achieve the rest. Think, my father,
when Cora shall meet your Zulma in the regions of peace,
and tell her, I am a Virgin of the Sun, condemned to death
because I loved——</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> No more!—All that lies within my
power shall be done. I will harangue, entreat, exert every
effort which the infirmities of age will permit!—Alas, the
hour of judgment approaches.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Oh fail not in your word!—Do all that you can
for Cora, and remember that my life hangs upon hers—But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
should your endeavours prove vain, you shall find that in
the mean time I have not been idle.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>Taking his hand mournfully</i>) May we
meet again, happier than we now part!—Farewell!—(<i>Exit</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE IV.—<i><span class="smcap">Rolla</span>, alone. He pauses, and looks
after the High-Priest—then strikes his forehead.</i></h3>

<p>Oh, my father, you know not what thoughts are brooding
here!—To your powers of eloquence alone, I dare
not trust a matter of this importance!—force!—force!—that
is the only effectual method of persuasion.—Where
can Velasquez be?—I would fain clasp him in my arms,
and endeavour to communicate to his breast, an ardour
equal to that which glows in mine. Yes, I will save her!—I
must save her!—My mother was a Virgin of the Sun,
though I must not dare to pronounce her name, lest the
echoes should learn to repeat it,—to rescue Cora is a
sacrifice due to her memory. Thus it is that the gods
wonderfully entwine together every link in the chain of
fate!—Ye powers of heaven!—you cannot be arraigned
if Rolla should die poor in deeds of heroism, since you
have not withheld glorious opportunities for their performance!—To
give freedom to her he loves, and to present
a grateful offering to his mother’s memory, are objects
of such magnitude, that if they did not raise a flame within
this bosom, it must have been moulded from the eternal snow
on the summits of the Cordilleras.</p>

<h3>SCENE V.—<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Don Juan</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Welcome, Velasquez!—I have waited for you
here!—I have occasion for your assistance.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> In what way?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Have you sufficient magnanimity to hazard
your life for a friend?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Most certainly, if it can be of any avail!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Then give me your hand.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Take it.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Cora and Alonzo are lost.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Alas!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> We must save them.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> If it be possible.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Only strike a bold stroke.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> With all my heart!—provided it be not a criminal
one.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Criminal!—Ha!—you have touched me indeed!—Yes,
I am afraid it too nearly resembles a crime!</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Then seek some other person to share in the
attempt.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Yet state the question thus.—Say, which is
most criminal, to institute, or to abolish, an inhuman
law?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> To effect the latter is an act of virtue.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Which we will practice.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> That is not in our power. This virtue can be
practised by the king alone.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Let us then counsel the king.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> To that I have no objection.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> But with arms in our hands.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Such counsel were rebellion.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> What signifies a name when good is to be
effected?</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> I am moreover much indebted to Ataliba, he
has received me with hospitality, has been my benefactor.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Your friend is in danger.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> I will not commit a crime even to save
<i>him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> How, if I engage my honour, that not a hair of
the king’s head, or of the heads of any of his servants, shall
be injured,—that we will conquer by fear alone?—You
know that I was once general of the army—by that army I
am still beloved; for the brave fellows have not forgotten
how often they triumphed under my command, nor that
when we were in the field together the lowest among them
was treated as my brother. To you also, Velasquez, the
king has entrusted the conduct of a valiant band. On the
least signal given, all who have borne arms under my
standard, will assemble round me—we will ask nothing for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
ourselves,—sacred shall be the throne—sacred the life and
property of every individual,—nothing shall be required
but freedom for Cora and Alonzo.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> Noble Rolla, you are blinded by love. Search
your heart, you will there detect, probably for the first
time, evil designs.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> I have no ears to listen to your morality. Virtue
is but an empty name, if it has never been opposed by
passion.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> And then the stronger the opposition the more
noble is the victory.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> It may be so, yet I can feel nothing but Cora’s
danger,—hear nothing but Cora’s voice crying for help!—Look,
here is Cora’s grave!—Icy-hearted man, behold
Cora’s grave!—Yet why waste time thus ineffectually?—What
interest have you in the fate of Cora?—Well then,
(<i>He seizes Juan’s hand in haste and agitation</i>) come with
me, I will lead you to the pile prepared for your friend!—If
at the sight of so dreadful an object your heart can suffer
your head to reason—if on that spot I cannot inspire you
with rage and anguish, equal to my own?—then farewel,
I must resign you wholly to your own apathy, and fly to
my mother’s grave,—there as I behold the wind waving the
blades of grass, and think whose form is mouldering beneath,
all your precepts will in a moment be forgotten, and
my soul be armed with new resolution. Come!—away!
(<i>Exit, drawing Juan after him</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE VI.—<i>The Court before the Temple. <span class="smcap">Xaira</span> in
conversation with other <span class="smcap">Priests</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> He stays a long time.</p>

<p><i>A Priest.</i> Very long.</p>

<p><i>Another.</i> The time is swiftly passing.</p>

<p><i>A Third.</i> ’Tis now past noon.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> What could the king want with him?</p>

<p><i>A Priest.</i> The messenger was wholly ignorant.</p>

<p><i>Another.</i> All he knew was, that the king required to
speak with the High-Priest, before sentence should be pronounced
upon Cora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> ’Tis very extraordinary.</p>

<p><i>A Priest.</i> The messenger was in great haste.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Probably the king wished to talk with him
about the sentence,—perhaps to consult with him on the
possibility of mitigating the punishment. Ah, my friends,
I fear that this Inca is not eager in promoting the vengeance
due to our offended gods. Didn’t you remark
with what reluctance he consented to Zorai’s being put in
irons?—with what compassion he looked upon the stranger?—nay,
that he even degraded his dignity, so far as to
speak to him?—His father was a very different sort of
man!</p>

<p><i>A Priest.</i> He was indeed.</p>

<p><i>Another.</i> He never omitted attendance at any sacrifice.</p>

<p><i>A Third.</i> And trembled whenever he entered the
Temple.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Nor ever failed in shewing due respect to our
sacred office.</p>

<p><i>A Priest.</i> Of reverencing our near intercourse with
the gods.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> He cast down his eyes with awe, where his son
looks up and smiles with thoughtless levity—exacted the
strictest justice, where his son would shew mercy. But
who are we to condemn?—who, but his tutor?—the man
to whom his education was entrusted?—in short, the
High-Priest. I will not say more now, this is neither the
place nor the time for long harangues; however I know
his principles. Take heed!—be on your guard!—</p>

<p><i>A Priest.</i> (<i>Interrupting him</i>) He comes.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> At last.</p>

<h3>SCENE VII.—<i>Enter the <span class="smcap">High-Priest</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> We have expected you impatiently.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> I was summoned away to the Inca.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Is the object of the interview a secret?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> By no means. Ataliba requires of the
judges of Cora and Alonzo, that they strictly examine
whether both be equally guilty, and whether the one might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
not have seduced the other—might not have thrown out
improper lures to lead astray the imagination.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Well, and supposing this should appear to be
the case.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Then he orders that the seducer only
shall suffer, and that the seduced shall be released.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Do I hear rightly?—Could the king say this,
and dare the High-Priest of the Sun repeat it after
him?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Why should he not?</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> “<i>The transgressors of the laws shall die.</i>”—Thus
spake our god himself.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Did you hear the god say this?—or was
it not rather spoken by the first Inca, as the ordinance of
our god?</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> ’Tis the same.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> That I readily allow.—The Inca is the
image of god upon earth, and the interpreter of his will;
but the last Inca is equally so with the first. The severe
laws, therefore, which his ancestor might find necessary
to institute among a wild and uncivilized people, the
descendant may be allowed to meliorate when the necessity
for their enforcement no longer exists.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> (<i>Sarcastically</i>) Why then not abolish them
entirely?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> To this the king was strongly inclined.
Yet he still thinks that he owes an example to the repose
of his people.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> <i>One</i> example only?—And what is that to be?—He
says that the guilty only shall die; but what earthly
wisdom is competent to decide this question?—Will
not both assert their innocence?—and will not each
endeavour to throw the blame of seduction upon the
other?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> ’Tis possible.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> What then is to direct our judgment?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Of that hereafter. At present, duty requires
that we obey the Inca’s mandate. Let Cora and
Alonzo be brought hither! (<i>Exit one of the Priests.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> No, I will not violate my principles, even to
gratify the Inca?—Both are guilty; and whether seducing,
or seduced, is a matter of total indifference. To his own
face I will tell the king the same,—I will sound it in the ears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
of the people—and if Ataliba no longer trembles before
the gods, he shall at least tremble before his own subjects.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Conscience is his law, and it ought equally
to be ours. We are to judge Cora and Alonzo, but let
us not forget that we ourselves are one day to be judged
by a superior power. Now take your places.</p>

<h3>SCENE VIII.—<i>The <span class="smcap">High-Priest</span> stands in the centre,
with <span class="smcap">Xaira</span> at his right hand, and the rest of the Priests
ranged in a semi-circle round the stage. <span class="smcap">Cora</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>, both in chains, are brought in on different sides.—Cora
no longer bears the image of the sun upon her
breast, nor her flame-coloured girdle.</i></h3>

<p><i>Cora.</i> My Alonzo!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Oh God!—you also in chains!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Mourn not my fate!—I shall die with you!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> With your murderer.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Silence!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>With mild solemnity</i>) We, the servants
of the gods, appointed to execute their holy will, are here
assembled to pass judgment upon Cora the daughter of Telasco,
and Alonzo the stranger.—Oh thou, our Father
above, who surveyest the whole world with one glance,
diffuse thy light into our hearts!—thou hast appointed us
judges over honour and shame, over life and death!—let
thy wisdom then enlighten our minds that no partiality may
bias them, that they may alike be free from weakness
and revenge. (<i>He kneels, accompanied by all the other
Priests.</i>) We swear, oh sun, to judge according to thy
laws communicated by Manco-Capac!—We swear to
shew mercy, if the profanation of thy temple will permit
mercy to be shewn—or if strict justice be required, to
exact strict justice!—We swear, finally, so to conduct ourselves,
that should we be called into thy presence to-morrow,
we may not be ashamed of rendering a faithful account
of this awful hour!</p>

<p><i>All the Priests.</i> We <i>swear</i> this, oh sun! (<i>They rise.</i>)</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Cora, have you broken your vow?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I have.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Do you know this young man?</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> He is my husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Alonzo, do you know this woman?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> She is my wife.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> You are both guilty—both must die.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Before we proceed to pass sentence upon
you, an important duty remains to be discharged. In the
name of our king, I am to announce favour to the party,
who was solely the victim of seduction. Ataliba, the first-born
of the sun, under whose dominion the kingdom of
Quito flourishes, requires a free and ingenuous confession,
which of you was the seducer, and which the seduced.</p>

</table>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Do not believe him, he speaks falsely.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Do not believe her, she would deceive you.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> I alone am guilty.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> On me must your sentence be pronounced.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Release him, he is innocent.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Shall the weakness of woman be punished?—No,
let the man make atonement.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Oh no!—for the love of heaven! (<i>The High-Priest
turns aside to conceal his emotions.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Silence!—Who can extract the truth amid this
confusion?—Let one only speak.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Cora begin!—Alonzo, do you remain
silent.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> The first time that I saw this young man was in
the temple. I immediately employed every artifice to attract
his attention,—I always made the longest pauses
wherever he was standing, and contrived various means to
continue near him—I drew aside my veil whenever I passed
him, and endeavoured by expressive glances to excite his
affections.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> ’Tis false!—Her eyes were always cast
downwards!</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Silence, stranger, it is not your turn to speak.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> My advances inspired him with boldness—he
sprang over the ruins of our sacred walls, yet scarcely was
he within their circuit, when, affrighted at his own rashness,
he was about to retreat without an interview. But his
figure had caught my attention as I was walking at a distance—I
called—I made signs to him when I ought to have
fled,—intercourse with him was forbidden to me,—intercourse
with me was not forbidden to him.—He stood trembling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
and irresolute, while I ran towards him, threw my
arms round his neck, and pressed my lips to his. Still he
was anxious to depart, but I detained him—he would not
have returned, but I entreated him—he described to
me the danger of my situation, but I refused to listen to
him. On me, on me, pass sentence, ye reverend judges,
it is I who have seduced.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Nature herself convicts you of falsehood.—Modesty
is the sister of beauty—the man <i>declares</i> love, the
woman only returns it. Who then can believe your story?—No,
ye priests, it was I, who, when I saw her in the
temple, first threw forbidden glances upon her, by which
I disturbed her quiet, and ruffled the sweet serenity of
her mind. It was I who disregarding the laws both of God
and man, with thoughtless confidence overleaped the sacred
walls, and when at sight of me she started back and would
have fled, I cast myself at her feet, and holding her by her
garments, forcibly detained her, to poison her mind with
flattery and deceit. But why should I urge all this?—Ye
judges, ye know the character of man, and must be assured,
by the feelings of your own hearts, that I was the seducer.
Pronounce your sentence then on me!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Recollect that he saved the Inca’s life!—Spare
him!—he is guiltless!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> She raves, she knows not what she says, I
alone am guilty.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Can you have a more convincing proof that I
only am the criminal, when you see me wholly unconcerned
and unmoved by any emotions of repentance,
while the stranger is bowed down with the weight of
his remorse. I glory in my guilt, and here in the presence
of the gods, in the presence of all these spectators, do I
embrace my husband! (<i>She rushes up to Alonzo, and
clasps him in her arms.</i>) Now observe his tremor—he
breaks from me, while I would still hang about him!—Can
you then doubt any longer?—’Tis I,—I only am
guilty.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Cora! Cora! Think of what you are doing!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Hear him, how he reproves, how he admonishes
me!—Thus has he ever done, yet I would not listen to
him, but regardless of his admonitions drew him with me
into this abyss of misery.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Shameless woman?—Tear her from him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Returning to her former station</i>) Now pronounce
sentence.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> I shudder.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Lead her away.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Spreading out his arms towards Cora</i>) Farewel!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> We shall soon meet again.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> In the hour of death.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> When a mightier power begins to spin the web
of a more blest existence!</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Lead her away.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Farewel.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> We part on this side of the grave with bitter tears,
to meet with smiles in the realms above. (<i>Cora and Alonzo
are guarded out on different sides.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> Need we any farther proof?—my voice is for
death!—death to both!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>Addressing the assembly with a mournful
voice.</i>) Follow me into the temple, and let us sacrifice to
the gods. Meantime, weigh well in your hearts what you
have seen and heard, and then as mortals, let us proceed to
pass our judgment upon mortals. (<i>Exeunt omnes.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE I.—<i>The Inside of the Temple of the Sun—at the
Back, the Image of the Sun upon an Altar raised some Steps
above the Ground. The <span class="smcap">High-Priest</span>, <span class="smcap">Xaira</span>, and
several other <span class="smcap">Priests</span>, the latter of whom are employed in
the Back Ground in burning Incense, and preparing the Sacrifices.
The <span class="smcap">High-Priest</span> advances to the Front of
the Stage with <span class="smcap">Xaira</span>.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">High-Priest.</span></p>

<p>Yet one word more, Xaira, ere, by pronouncing a
hasty sentence, we profane the sacred name we bear. Are
we not ministers of the divine favour?</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> And of the divine vengeance.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Vengeance!—Can we suppose that the
merciful God seeks vengeance on his creatures?—No, if
this principle has been encouraged to awe the vulgar, we
who are initiated into the mysteries of a purer doctrine,
may speak to each other without reserve.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> For what purpose?—and why at this moment?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Because an error committed at this moment,
may draw after it an eternity of misery to us both.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> My conduct is the result of my conviction.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Then surely that cannot be just. God
created man weak and liable to err, a truth on which your
conviction should be founded. This earth is imperfect, so
is every thing that lives and moves in it, and will not
that God who suffers the tyger to mangle the harmless lamb,
look down with forbearance on frail man when he listens
to the voice of nature.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> But we men slay the tyger, and we do right,—we
punish the faults of man, and we do right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Yes, if by his weakness he produce disorder
in the state.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> And is not that the case in the affair before us?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> No!</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> No?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Your own designs have been solely to
avenge the gods.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> And would you then sanction the licentious
conduct that must inevitably ensue, should indulgence be
shewn in the present instance?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> At the source of a clear stream, we
do not think of the mud by which it may be contaminated
in its course. I entreat you, let us be true to our
vocation, let us resemble the god whom we serve,
whose rays diffuse light and heat over all! let us
acquit Cora!—It will then lie in the king’s bosom to
act as he shall judge right, either by confirming, or reversing,
our sentence; and should it be reversed, we shall, at
least, have done our duty, in shewing a disposition to clemency,
while the hapless victim will breathe her last sighs
in gratitude for our intended mercy.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> What would you require of me?—You speak
as if the decision of this point rested upon me alone. Are
not you High-Priest?—do not the duties of your office
demand that you lay the case before the whole assembly of
the Priests, in which I have but a single voice.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> You know well, that in representing this
affair to the assembly, I am forbidden by our laws to employ
any persuasions of eloquence,—what I am to say,
must be expressed in the fewest and the simplest words, and
I am therefore precluded from the power of influencing the
auditors. You, it is true, have only one voice, but you
are the oldest of the order, next to me, and successor to the
high-priesthood at my death. To you therefore all the
young Priests look up, and will incline which way soever
they shall see you inclined.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> This case may be rightly stated as to what
concerns yourself, but it is otherwise with the Inca who
has always power to grant a pardon.</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> But when has this power been exercised?—Has
not every Inca, from father to son, for centuries
past, uniformly confirmed the sentence of the Priests?—will
Ataliba, think you, venture to deviate from the practice
of his ancestors?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> No more!—It is equally inconsistent with
your duty to endeavour to extort from me the sentence I
shall pronounce, as with mine to listen to such entreaties.
(<i>Turns away from him</i>)</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Well then, their blood be upon thee!</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> (<i>Coldly.</i>) Yes, their blood be upon me!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Hither ye Priests! (<i>The Priests assemble
round him</i>) I already read in their gloomy countenances
the sentence I am to expect! (<i>Aside.—After a few
moments pause, in which he endeavours to assume resolution,
he proceeds</i>) You know the criminals and the crime—we
wait your decision.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> What say the laws? (<i>The High-Priest remains
silent</i>) I ask you what say the laws?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>After a conflict with himself, in suffocated
voice</i>) Death.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> (<i>Solemnly and audibly</i>) The laws pronounce
sentence of death upon Cora and Alonzo.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Death!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>After a pause, and in a tone of resolution</i>)
I cannot give my sanction to this sentence, my opinion inclines
to mercy; I feel that I am myself a mortal liable to
error. Search your bosoms, my brethren, prove well your
hearts, and if they in a low and gentle voice whisper
<i>mercy</i>,—then join with me and cry aloud mercy!—mercy!</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> What say the laws?—Death to Cora and
Alonzo.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Death!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Then it must be as you decide.—Oh
thou unknown God, look down upon us, observe that
none of this blood stains my hands!—Bring hither the unfortunate
victims of your blind zeal. (<i>Exeunt two Priests
on different sides</i>) The rest of you lay the sword and a
fresh branch of palm upon the altar. (<i>They do as he directs</i>)
Now, Xaira, follow me to the king. (<i>Exit, accompanied
by Xaira</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE II.—<i><span class="smcap">Cora</span> and <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span> are brought in on different
sides. During this and the following scene, the Priests
walk backwards and forwards, and are busied about the
altar. <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span> appears a few minutes sooner than <span class="smcap">Cora</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> I am struck with awe!—This temple, it is true, is
only dedicated to the worship of an idol, but God is every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
where; even in this place, where he is adored under the image
of one of his own works. This temple I have profaned!—I
am brought hither as the murderer of an artless woman—as
the murderer of a venerable old man who never
wronged me—as the murderer of a gallant youth, one of the
destined supports of his country—as one who has disturbed
the peace of a liberal nation, among whom he has been received
with unbounded hospitality!—Oh earth! earth! open wide,
and swallow at once this monster with all his crimes!—may
no grass ever grow upon his grave!—may it never be moistened
with the dew of Heaven!—may no wanderer ever repose
his wearied limbs upon the sods, and may they never
be trodden by the innocent feet of children, in their harmless
sports! (<i>Cora enters.</i>) Ah, Cora! how blest did the
sight of you once make me!—how miserable does it make
me now!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Alonzo, this cannot be uttered from your heart!—Have
you not often declared, that if you could not live
with Cora, you would die with her; and Cora has always
thought the same in respect to her Alonzo. Yes, we
will die together, that we may live together hereafter!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Oh that hereafter!—It is the haven of rest to
the virtuous, but for me, an evil conscience accompanies
me to the grave.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Do not think so!—we have neither of us done
wrong!—we loved each other—we could not avoid loving;
was it in the power of either to repress our mutual
feelings? Can either of us then be criminal?—Chance,
or perhaps our God himself, first brought us together—all
is of his appointment, and I am resigned to my fate.
Even man is kind to us, since he facilitates our union. As a
Virgin of the Sun I could not have become your wife, but
in death we shall be united. Resume your fortitude then,
oh Alonzo!—How often have I sprung with you over the
rugged stones at the breach?—Death is no more than a
spring over a few rugged stones; and these once passed,
we shall find love and freedom waiting to receive us on the
other side.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Amiable creature!—thy guiltless soul can look
with composure both towards the past and future.—But for
me!——</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> How, if I can prove that you may more justly
look with composure towards futurity, than Cora?—Your
mother is far hence, and should she hear of you no more,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
will believe that your days were ended by shipwreck, sickness,
or some common disaster, and this idea will console
her for your loss; while her maternal fancy will see in her
son nothing but what was fair and good, will frequently
recur with transport to the noble actions he has already
performed, and form to itself a thousand charming images
of what he would have achieved had his life been longer
spared. But I!—I have a father, at present, indeed, in a
remote province; but who will soon learn for what offence,
and in what manner, his daughter died. It is that
thought alone which makes death dreadful to me!—He
is so good, so venerable, and loves me so tenderly!—Were
he to witness this scene, it would break his heart.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> (<i>Aside</i>) Oh Heaven! then she knows not——</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Within the last hour I fell upon my knees and
prayed most fervently, that some calm and easy death might
snatch my father from the world, before his daughter’s fate
could reach his ears. Suddenly a sweet serenity was diffused
over my soul, as if the mild rays of a new sun had
fallen upon me; and I hoped this was an assurance that my
prayer was heard. My remaining wish is, that what
I must suffer may be over quickly, lest solemn and protracted
preparations should excite my rebel senses to mutiny,
and shake my fortitude.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Oh it is the thought of what you have already endured,
and must still endure, which alone oppresses my soul.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Let not my sufferings oppress you; believe me,
I am resigned.</p>

<h3>SCENE III.—<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Telasco</span>, with <span class="smcap">Zorai</span> in chains.</i></h3>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Uttering a loud and piercing shriek</i>) Oh, I am
heard!—Behold my father’s spirit!—Yet his features are
full of indignation!—his countenance is terrible!—Alonzo,
awake me from this dream!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Would to God it were, indeed, only your
father’s shade!—but, alas! it is he himself.—Oh what an
hour of horror!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Casting a look of awe towards Telasco</i>) My father!</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> (<i>To Zorai</i>) Why was I brought hither at this
moment?—Do not the important services which I have
done my native country through so long a course of years,
give me a just claim to expect some forbearance? Go and
demand of the priests if I must be compelled to stay with
her,—I will, meanwhile, support myself against this pillar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Approaching him with trembling steps</i>) My
father!</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> (<i>With agony</i>) Save me Zorai—save me!</p>

<p><i>Zorai.</i> (<i>Thrusting Cora away</i>) Hence serpent!—spare
the old man at least in his last moments. (<i>Telasco turns
away his face</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Falling upon her knees, and clasping her hands in
agony</i>) Brother!</p>

<p><i>Zorai.</i> I, thy brother!—Alas, yes!—these chains speak
too plainly that I am thy brother.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Father!</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> (<i>With still averted eyes</i>) Who calls me by that
name?—I do not know that voice!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Father!—brother!—Oh these are the only agonies
of death! (<i>Wringing her hands</i>)</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> (<i>Turning his eyes towards Cora</i>) Oh Zorai,
my paternal feelings will not be suppressed!—It is the voice
of her mother!—it is the form of her mother!—Cora!—Cora—I
have passed through life with honour, and now
you cover my grave with shame!—Away, away! nor
hope to experience my compassion!—Do you deserve it?—Did
I constrain you to devote your youth to the service
of the sun?—Did I not, on the contrary, frequently admonish
you to consider well what you intended? Did I
not represent to you, that the world afforded many pleasures
of which you were then ignorant, and which you
would first learn to think desirable when their enjoyment
would be criminal, and when your life would consequently
be rendered miserable by the impossibility of their attainment?
Even on the very last evening before your irrevocable
oath was taken—(God only knows how I assumed
courage for the purpose)—did I not again entreat you to
reflect upon all these things while it was yet possible to retract?—Dark
and gloomy then appeared the future to my
soul, as the ocean on a cloudy day. Even you wept—yes,
Cora, you wept; your heart was overpowered.—It was
the warning voice of a guardian spirit within you; but you
resisted the impulse, adhered firmly to your enthusiastic
resolution, and would think of nothing but of a nearer intercourse
with the gods—Behold us now standing here,—I,
a poor old man with my grey hairs, mourning the honour
of my house destroyed for ever;—this youth, full of energy
and love for his native country, cut off even in the prime
of life, guiltless himself, yet involved in your destiny;—both,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
both, murdered by the hand of a daughter—of a sister;—and
worse than murdered, hurled to the grave with
shame as their companion!—Oh that I should have lived
to see this day!—Blest, blest, was thy mother’s lot, that
she died before the dawn of so fatal a morning! (<i>Cora,
overpowered with her father’s reproaches, sinks to the ground
with a sigh; Telasco exclaims with an emotion of tenderness</i>)
Zorai, support her!</p>

<p><i>Zorai.</i> (<i>Raising up his sister, in which Alonzo makes an
effort to assist him, but is thrust back by Zorai</i>) Hence, thou
murderer of innocence!—Oh that a hero should thus sink
to nothing when we behold him near!—How did I reverence
this man at a distance!—how admire him when I
listened to the detail of his noble actions!—I felt my young
heart elevated, and wished for nothing so ardently as that
I were myself in his place!—Fool that I was!—His heroism
was the effect of chance, not principle; he is still
but a man, and weak as the rest of mankind!—Look here,
and exult at this scene, it is thy work; and thou may’st
thank these chains that, even in the midst of the temple, and
in the presence of our god himself, thou art not made the
victim of my vengeance.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Did you know how my heart is tortured, how
inexpressibly I love, you would be more compassionate to
my sorrows!</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> Say no more, my son—his fate is much more
deplorable than ours: we have one treasure left, which we
shall carry with us to another world, a pure conscience;—that
treasure he has lost; he is poorer than ourselves.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Oh, my father, do not let me die in despair!—Can
you refuse me your blessing in the hour of death!
(<i>She falls at his feet</i>) I will cling round your knees, my
anguish shall move you!—have pity on your kneeling
daughter!—bless me, my father!—forgive me, my brother!
(<i>Telasco and Zorai appear much affected</i>) See how I humble,
how I twine myself about you!—Oh, my agony is inconceivable!—Have
compassion upon me, or my heart will
break!</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> Son! son!—let us not aggravate the bitter
stroke of death!—the wretched easily forgive!—Raise her
up to my arms. (<i>Zorai raises up his sister. Telasco clasps
her to his breast</i>) Die in peace—I forgive thee!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>In a faint voice</i>) My brother!</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> Yes, yes, Zorai!—no resentment!—forgive
the penitent!—call her sister!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p><i>Zorai.</i> (<i>Embracing her</i>) Unhappy—sister!</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Ye gods, I thank you!—the bitterness of death
is past.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Your hearts are softened!—Might Alonzo
venture!—Zorai, you called me a weak man. Yes, I am
weak; but I am not a villain!—Misery soon unites the
sufferers to each other—let us not die in enmity.</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> Stranger, I harbour no resentment against you!—Can
I leave the world in a better state of mind, than in
speaking pardon to those by whom I have been injured.
Have you any parents living?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> An aged mother.</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> For her sake come hither, that I may bless
thee in her place! (<i>He embraces him</i>)</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> From what a grievous burden is my heart relieved!—And
you too Zorai! (<i>Offering him his hand</i>)</p>

<p><i>Zorai.</i> Away! I admire my father’s conduct; but—I
cannot follow his example.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Not to give peace to a dying man?</p>

<p><i>Zorai.</i> I cannot!—Would you have me dissemble reconciliation?—You
are hateful to me!—leave me!—I
will endeavour to subdue this bitter feeling; and should I
succeed, I will reach out my hand as our last moments approach,
and you will understand my meaning.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Accept my thanks even for this concession.—I
acknowledge it to be more than I deserve. (<i>Cora leans
against a pillar, and endeavours to recover herself</i>).</p>

<h3>SCENE IV.—<i>Enter the <span class="smcap">High-Priest</span>, <span class="smcap">Xaira</span>, and
several other <span class="smcap">Priests</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> The king approaches!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i>The Priests range themselves on the steps of the altar;
<span class="smcap">Cora</span>, <span class="smcap">Telasco</span>, and <span class="smcap">Zorai</span>, remain in the front of the
stage on one side; <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span> stands opposite to them; <span class="smcap">Ataliba</span>,
attended by his suite, enters with slow and solemn
steps, and with a countenance marked with deep anxiety;
he kneels before the Image of the Sun, and remains for some
time in an attitude of devotion, while a solemn silence is observed
by all present. When his prayer is finished, he rises,
and turns towards <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span>, to whom he speaks hastily, and
in a low voice.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Save yourself, Alonzo!—Urge that you are
a foreigner, and were unacquainted with our laws and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
customs!—urge your services to the state, to me, to the people!—urge,
in short, whatever your danger may suggest!—Your
judge is your friend, let it be possible for him to
shew you mercy without incurring a suspicion partiality.
(<i>Alonzo bows silently, with a countenance expressive of ardent
gratitude. Ataliba turns to Telasco</i>) Good old man, you
are free!—He who has hazarded his life a thousand times
in the service of his native country, has sacrificed it already
to the gods. I dare not proceed against you!</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> How, Inca!—Can you be so cruel as to deprive
the aged tree of all its branches, and yet leave the
trunk standing?</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>To Zorai</i>) Young man, you also are free!
(<i>Turning to the assembly</i>) For it is the will of my father, that
henceforward the guilty only shall suffer. (<i>A murmuring
is heard among the priests; Ataliba casts a look of displeasure
upon them, and again addresses Zorai</i>) Comfort your aged
father, nurse him and attend upon him as long as he lives;
then come to me, as to your elder brother. (<i>Zorai attempts
to throw himself at the king’s feet, who prevents him,
and turns to Cora</i>) For you, Cora,—I can do nothing.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Oh, you have done all that I could wish!—more
than I could dare to hope.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Your offence comes immediately within the
laws, and to the laws the king himself is subject. (<i>He
ascends to the upper step of the altar, prostrates himself once
more before the Image of the Sun, and then turns towards the
assembly</i>) High-Priest, execute your office!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Pardon me, good Inca!—spare my age!—my
infirm state of health!—my throbbing heart!—Permit
Xaira on this occasion to take my place.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Be it as you desire!</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> (<i>Approaching him with solemnity</i>) First born of
the Sun, a virgin, devoted to the gods, has broken her sacred
vow!—Cora, come forwards!—A stranger who sojourns
in this land is the associate of her crime!—Alonzo,
come forwards!—We, the priests of the incensed gods,
and servants of the Temple which has been profaned,
faithful to the ordinances of thy great ancestor, have sat in
judgment upon their crime, and pronounced sentence upon
both.—This sentence is <span class="smcap">death</span>!!!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>After a pause, addressing Cora and Alonzo</i>)
Have you anything to say in your defence? (<i>Cora and
Alonzo remain silent</i>) I ask you, Cora, and you, Alonzo,
if you have any thing to urge in your defence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> Nothing.</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Nothing.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> How, Alonzo, have you nothing to urge in
extenuation of your conduct?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> Nothing.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Do not speak rashly!—I give you time for recollection!—Consider
well—<span class="smcap">Stranger</span>!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> I have deserved death, and submit to it
willingly.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Once more I admonish you to consider well
what you are about—a few moments longer, and it will be
too late.—Oh ye assembled judges, know that I regard it
as a sacred duty to grant this indulgence, since this man is
a stranger, and could not be impressed with that sacred reverence
for our faith, which the wisdom of our priests instils
from their earliest infancy into the breast of every
Peruvian. Unacquainted with our laws, he could not see
with our eyes, could not know the magnitude of his transgression.
Once more, Alonzo, you are at liberty to
speak.—Our gods are just, reasonable, merciful!</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> I have deserved death.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Is that your last word?</p>

<p><i>Alonzo.</i> My last.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>Rests his elbow upon the altar, and conceals his
face in his hands for some moments, then, recovering himself,
proceeds</i>) Priests, perform your duty!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i>Two priests ascend to the altar, one on each side of the
king. One takes the sword, the other the palm-branch
from the altar, when, descending again, they deliver them
to Xaira.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> (<i>Presenting the sword to the king</i>) First born
of the Sun, receive from my hands the symbol of justice!
(<i>Presenting the palm-branch</i>) First born of the Sun, receive
from my hands the symbol of mercy!—The gods
direct your judgment!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>Kneels</i>) Oh God, thou seest how my heart is
racked at this awful hour!—Grant that I may never again
be compelled to the performance of so mournful a duty!—Ye
shades of my forefathers, hover over me!—let me be
enlightened by your wisdom, and since I exact no more
than justice demands, let my soul find rest in that reflection.
(<i>He rises—Cora, Alonzo, Telasco, and Zorai, kneel with
their heads bowed down.—After a few minutes struggle with
himself, the king raises the sword, and is about to speak.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<h3>SCENE V.—<i>Enter the <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span> in great haste,
and with a strong impression of terror upon his countenance.</i></h3>

<p><i>Chamberlain.</i> Pardon me, royal Inca, that I must be
the messenger of evil tidings. The flame of insurrection
rages among the people—they run wildly hither and thither
about the streets—the troops assemble on all sides, crying
to arms! to arms!—Drums beat, trumpets sound, weapons
clash, and a forest of lances are collected together.
No answer is to be obtained to a single question; all that
is to be heard is the name of Rolla shouted by ten thousand
voices. The troop belonging to the foreigner Velasquez,
was drawn up in the meadow; I saw him run hastily from
one soldier to another; and could plainly perceive by his
gestures, that he entreated, threatened, expostulated, and
employed every effort to restrain them within their duty,
but in vain, all by turns deserted to Rolla. (<i>The whole
assembly, except the king, manifest great consternation and
alarm.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> What can this mean?—Rolla, did you say,
at the head of the army?—that cannot be insurrection.—Rolla’s
name can never be united with insurrection—this
must be a mistake. Did you see him yourself?</p>

<p><i>Chamberlain.</i> Only at a distance. The officers had
made a little circle round him, he harangued them eagerly,
and with a loud voice, his eyes flashed fire, which seemed
to communicate to those about him, who frequently interrupted
his harangue with impetuous shouts, then brandishing
their swords and shaking their lances, they began to
throng towards the Temple, the whole multitude following
them, while I hastened on before, to prepare you for
their reception.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>Without changing countenance</i>) Well, all
will soon be explained. (<i>He looks around</i>) I see terror
pourtrayed on every countenance.—Why are you dismayed?—He
who only studies to promote his people’s
happiness, has no reason to fear his people. In that conviction
my heart finds repose. Let them come! (<i>A noise
is heard behind the scenes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>All present cry with confusion.</i> They come!—they are
here already!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<h3>SCENE VI.—<i><span class="smcap">Rolla</span> rushes in with a drawn sword in his
right hand, a javelin in his left, and a bow and quiver at
his back. He is followed by a considerable number of
<span class="smcap">Officers</span> and <span class="smcap">Soldiers</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Be guided by me, my friends.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> A profanation of the Temple!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> You have profaned it by a sanguinary sentence.</p>

<p><i>Xaira.</i> (<i>To the assembled Priests</i>) Avenge your gods!
(<i>A confused murmuring is heard among them</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>To Xaira</i>) Silence!—(<i>He makes a motion
with his hand, signifying that he is about to speak, when a
general silence is observed. He then turns to Rolla, and addresses
him</i>) Who are you?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Do you not know me?</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> I had once a chieftain, who much resembled
you in features—his name was Rolla, and he was a noble-minded
man.—But who are you?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> No mockery Inca!—for the love of God no
mockery!—Yet you may be right—I am no longer Rolla—I
no longer know myself!—A storm drives me on!—a rapid
stream hurries me forwards!—but have compassion
upon me!—I honour you, Inca—I love and honour you
truly.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> You honour me?—Once indeed I indulged
in such glorious visions, I said within myself, as long as I
have Rolla for a chieftain, the monarch of Cuzco may rage,
may try to seduce my provinces from their obedience, yet
Rolla’s heroic courage is a tree under whose shade I shall
always repose in peace.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> But answer me, I entreat?—is the tree under
whose shade you were reposing thus quietly, responsible to
itself, if a whirlwind should come, tear it up by the roots,
and throw it down upon you?</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> What whirlwind has seized upon you?—what
is it you desire?—speak, and thank your former services,
that you are now indulged with the liberty of speaking. I
have never sufficiently rewarded your heroic achievements,
I do it now, in granting this permission.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> I have only a plain story to urge in my defence,
let it suffice for my vindication, if you partake more of the
human, than of the divine nature!—I love to excess!—While
I was still a boy, this passion stole into my heart so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
sweetly, so pleasantly, so devoid of all uneasiness, that I felt
delight in cherishing and indulging it. Love was at that
time like a day of serenity to my soul, and remained so, till
the period of youth intervened, when my passion became a
storm, to which all must bend,—when nothing could restrain
the impetuosity of my feelings. To love and be beloved
were the highest objects to which I aspired—I thought
of nothing but enjoying my sweet intoxication in Cora’s
arms, regardless of honour or of the services due to my
country, and to the noble race of our Incas, of which tree
I am a branch. My good uncle sought to stem the torrent,
or at least to conduct it into another channel, and
sent me to serve my king in battle, trusting that the fever
which burned within me, might thus in time be wholly exhausted.
But vain was the hope, that in urging my steps
to climb the lofty heights of honour, I might be enabled
when I had gained their summit, to look down with calmness
on the passion I had left below. This passion would
not be shaken off—it accompanied me up the steep, and it
was that alone which prompted all my heroic actions. Yes,
Inca, whatever great or good I have performed in your
service, is to be ascribed solely to love—it was my companion
in the field of battle, and in my most adventurous moments,
I thought not of my king nor of his throne, neither
of the welfare of my country; I only thought of Cora—that
I should become the object of Cora’s admiration—You
owe nothing to me, all to my love for that matchless woman,
and that love you must this day pardon. I am past
the days of youth indeed, but my heart remains the same,
it retains all the impetuosity of my earlier years; I still
cherish the lovely visions of childhood; my passion is become
like a tree, the root of which is so deeply entwined
with my life, that the one cannot be plucked up without
destroying the other. Oh, Inca, shew that you have the
feelings of a man!—extend your mercy to Cora!—on my
knees I intreat for her life! (<i>He kneels</i>) Since she has
called the forsaken Rolla, brother, he is become proud,
yet he still condescends on his knees to beg his sister’s life.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>Endeavouring to conceal his emotions and preserve
his dignity</i>) Rise!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Mercy!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Rise!—lay thy arms at my feet, dismiss thy
followers, and then wait silently, and submissively, the
judgment of thy king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Mercy!—Mercy!—Uncle, Sister, aid me to
entreat!—I have been so little accustomed to entreaty,
that I scarcely know the form in which it should be
clothed.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> A petitioner in arms!—would you mock your
sovereign?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Rising up</i>) Oh no!—but you require impossibilities—you
expect a man in a burning fever to sleep.
Can Rolla behold Cora in chains, and lay down his arms?—by
Heaven that cannot be!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> I command you to deposit them at my feet.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Pronounce her pardon Inca!—declare her absolved
from her detested vow, and you shall instantly be
obeyed.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> No conditions—your arms must instantly be
resigned.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Impossible!—Come to my heart, Cora!—be
my breast your shield, and let my sword hew asunder those
chains!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Rebel, do whatever you please.—whatever the
gods will permit—but know that Ataliba will not pronounce
sentence till he beholds you kneeling disarmed at
his feet. Never shall it be said, that you <i>extorted</i> mercy
from the king. (<i>In a pathetic tone</i>) Ye people of Quito,
listen to the voice of your sovereign!—I stand here at this
moment, in the temple, in the presence of our God himself!—For
seven years have I now reigned over you, I
ask if any one can charge me during that time with a wilful
injustice?—if any can, let him come forwards!—Has any
one been dismissed from before my throne without assistance,
where assistance could be granted?—if any has, let him
come forwards!—I have conquered other countries, I have
triumphed over other kings, but that is little.—When a
few years ago the anger of the gods had cursed the country
with unfruitfulness, I threw open the doors of my full
barns, fed the hungry, and revived the sick, while many a
night I lay sleepless in my own bed, because your misery
oppressed my soul, and I had not power to relieve all. Ye
people of Quito your present conduct is undeserved by me!—Seize
that man, chain him, or I lay down my sceptre at
this moment. (<i>A confused murmuring is heard among the
crowd.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Turning to his followers</i>) You seize me!—you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
put me in chains!—which among you will do this?—You
perhaps, my old companion in battle, with whom I
once shared my last morsel when famine stared us in the
face?—or you, whose life I saved in the field of Tumibamba?—or
you, whose son I rescued from the enemy’s hands,
even at the moment when the lance was pointed against
his breast?—Which among you will seize me?—Speak?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Rolla, my adopted son, how am I bowed
down by this scene. Would you see me, miserable old man,
as I am, prostrate at your feet?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Forbear!—I honour you as a father, but do
not spread out your hands to the stormy winds,—it is in
vain! (<i>The High-Priest is about to proceed in his entreaties,
but Rolla prevents him impatiently</i>) Uncle, no more!—the
lots are cast, and whatever may be the consequence I
am resolved to save Cora.</p>

<p><i>Cora.</i> (<i>Goes up to Rolla, embraces and kisses him</i>) Brother,
take this kiss from your sister, and let these tears speak
my gratitude for love so ardent. Your soul is truly noble,—this
day, for the first time in my life, have I really known
you. But one so great, so good, must be his sovereign’s
friend. Cora has been guilty of a crime, and would you
seek to shelter her by the commission of another? Oh,
what an added weight of remorse would that reflection heap
upon my already overburthened conscience!—No, Rolla,
do not act thus beneath yourself!—do not seek to snatch the
reins from the hands of God, who assuredly directs my fate!—Suffer
me to die!—I have received my father’s and my
brother’s forgiveness; Alonzo dies with me, and I die
contentedly. Our spirits shall hover around you, and will
rejoice when they behold you true to your king, and devoting
all your powers to the service of your country.—resolve
to endure the remainder of your life without me!—it
is my last request, and I know that Rolla will yield to
Cora’s entreaty; then will she have performed a good action
at her departure from the world, and will be indebted
to her brother for that grateful reflection. Yes, Rolla, I
see the clouds upon your brow dispersing, I see tears start
into your eyes—do not repress them,—give them free scope—they
are no disgrace even to the eyes of a warrior.—And
now, my brother, give me your sword, your javelin!—(<i>She
takes his sword and javelin gently out of his hands, and
lays them at Ataliba’s feet</i>) Behold now a hero indeed!—With<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
those tears that are trembling on his cheeks, has
he washed away the stain which was beginning to tarnish
his fame and virtue—now Rolla, I am indeed proud of your
love!—One only effort sill remains, throw yourself at the
feet of our good king—kneel to him, and let virtue remain
sole victor! (<i>She draws him gently towards Ataliba, at
whose feet she throws herself.—Rolla, after a few moments’
struggle with himself, kneels by her—Cora addresses the king</i>)
Oh sovereign of Quito, I bring you back your hero!—pardon
him!—he deserves your pardon! (<i>She rises and returns
to her former station.</i>) Now Inca, proceed to judgment!
(<i>Rolla remains kneeling before the king</i>)</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> (<i>Embracing Cora</i>) My daughter!—for as such
I may now embrace thee without shame.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Does Rolla submit to his king?</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Entirely.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Your life is forfeited.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> Of that I am sensible.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> You have my free pardon.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Raising up his eyes to the king with haste and
anxiety</i>) And Cora?</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> You are pardoned.</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> (<i>Casting his eyes again to the ground</i>) Oh God!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Rise!</p>

<p><i>Rolla.</i> No, let me hear the sentence upon my knees,
for in pronouncing Cora’s doom you pronounce mine.</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Well then! (<i>He takes again into his hands
the sword and palm-branch, which at the beginning of the
tumult he had laid upon the altar.</i>)</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> (<i>Throwing himself suddenly at the king’s
feet</i>) Oh Inca, pardon them!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> (<i>Raising him up with mildness</i>) Do you also ask
this, my father?—have the gods manifested their will to
you?</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Mercy is the will of the gods!—Those
rude times when your illustrious ancestor first established
the worship of the sun are no more. Naked as the beasts
of the forest, our race then lived under the open canopy of
Heaven alone, while their women were considered like the
dates upon the palm-tree, as fruit which every one might
pluck according to his fancy. At that time they had no
subsistence but what they could snatch precariously from
day to day,—they were without religion, without laws,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
without property. Then Manco-Capac, endowed with
supernatural powers, appeared among them—he built a
temple to the sun, and consecrated virgins to his service,
instituting at the same time the vow of chastity, because vice
reigned so triumphantly throughout the kingdom, and reason
was so much in its infancy, that without such a precaution,
the temple on the solemn days of festival had become
a theatre of debauchery. But a long series of years
has changed what was then a forced obedience to the laws
of order, into an inward feeling of their beauty, and where
this rules, compulsive institutions are no longer necessary.
Therefore, Inca, I stand here in the name of the gods, and
call upon you, as the benefactor of your people, to crown
all your noble deeds with a sacrifice due to reason, and
through her to the gods themselves. Shrink not from the
trial!—be eager to do what is right, or if any thing still
be wanting to your conviction, let the supplication of an
old man at least move you!—the supplication of one by
whom you were educated, who loves you as his own son,
who has watched with anxious care your infant slumbers,
and who now asks this mercy as the recompence of all his
cares! (<i>He takes the fillet from his head and shews his grey
hair.</i>) Grant this request, oh Inca, for the sake of these
grey hairs, become thus silvery in your service!</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Enough!—Come forwards, Cora!—and you,
Alonzo!</p>

<p><i>High-Priest.</i> Ye gods, direct his noble heart!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i><span class="smcap">Cora</span> and <span class="smcap">Alonzo</span> come forwards trembling.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Telasco.</i> (<i>To Zorai</i>) Support me, my son,—support
me!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i><span class="smcap">Ataliba</span> after a solemn pause, with his right hand strikes
the sword against the ground and breaks it, then with his
left presents the palm-branch to <span class="smcap">Cora</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ataliba.</i> Be the law abolished, and Cora released!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i><span class="smcap">Cora</span> sinks down in a swoon,—<span class="smcap">Alonzo</span> throws himself by
her—<span class="smcap">Rolla</span> springs up and presses the king wildly to
his breast.—The <span class="smcap">High-Priest</span> raises his hands gratefully
towards Heaven—<span class="smcap">Telasco</span> supported by <span class="smcap">Zorai</span>
totters towards his daughter,—The people shout repeatedly,

<p><i>All.</i> Long live the Inca!!! (<i>The Curtain falls.</i>)</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
